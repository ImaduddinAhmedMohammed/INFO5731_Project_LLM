"> we should also see a map of what North America would be without ""help""/interference from European nations

Not much would have changed. Neither France nor Spain could afford to keep their colonies in North America and the British Empire at the time was at war with a quarter of Earth, and far more focused on the West Indies and India during the uprising by the American colonies. If you're curious about the personalities who made things happen, I'd check Mike Duncan's Revolutions podcast which does a good job walking through the history with more a focus on the who and why than on the military tactics. [Because as strategists have known for centuries, political conflicts are the cause, not consequence, of war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_War)",2

"I donâ€™t think itâ€™s capitalism, but thatâ€™s just the inherent problem with AI philosophy. Itâ€™s all about making _everything_ as profitable and optimised as possible. Which is fine in a factory, but you canâ€™t make everything better by adding a machine to do it for you.  

An AI that does your education for you makes your education useless. An AI that makes art churns out soulless, profitable pieces that donâ€™t involve the actual process of art. An AI that works as a therapist will be completely ineffective because therapy is all about human connection.  

Itâ€™s like they think they can just make some profitability algorithms, design a big complex machine, and plug it in to magically solve all the problems the algorithm identified. Thatâ€™s not how things work.",3
"this is the way.you did the right thing. you have to learn how to recognise ai, it is possible.",2

The degree I get will be the degree I deserve.",1
Man itâ€™s a good thing homework isnâ€™t assigned for the purpose of mastering skills that can be useful in a career.,1
"I will say change the assignments! I am recently using a lot of ChatGPT for my professional coding stuff, and it's a skill.

Maybe change your assignments to more interactive and discussion based because writing boiler plate code is literally useless starting inception of these tools.

Maybe focus on concepts and assignments, be in person and talking. Dm me if you want to chat quickly.

But redesign to something like fundamental on changing values of variables or memory management where when if they ask the question to chatgpt they will still need to understand and explain it. And I highly encourage you to let them use it. Otherwise, that's something of an old school road you will force on them.

Getting good code generated from these models is a skill",1
"Summarizing research? There is a chatgpt plugin for scholarly work

Considering how time consuming sifting through google scholar can be, chatgpt can really improve that type of work once the plugins get a bit better",2
And without anyone double checking the answer.,3
"Not sure what's wrong about this -- I use it the same way often. For example, if you want to find out which API call is the right one, you can ask GPT to generate some code: it's excellent (much better than Google) at interpreting instructions in human language and looking for synonyms or similar phrases in all the documentation to which it has access.

I still use search engines, mainly to search for the documentation of some library, or to search for the website of some public utility, or something along those lines.

Different tools have different uses. ChatGPT is absolutely a better tool than Google to look up certain kinds of information.",3
"Homework makes no sense. From beginning of its existence students have tried and keep trying to find ways to not do it, to do it easier or to do it faster. This is simply next step of ""can I copy your homework"". Maybe this time around it will finally come through that there's no point to it.",1

""The Japanese had, in fact, already sued for peace. The atomic bomb played no decisive part, from a purely military point of view, in the defeat of Japan.""
  
  
â€”â€ŠFleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Commander in Chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet

&#x200B;

""The use of \[the atomic bombs\] at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no material assistance in our war against Japan. The Japanese were already defeated and ready to surrender because of the effective sea blockade and the successful bombing with conventional weapons ... The lethal possibilities of atomic warfare in the future are frightening. My own feeling was that in being the first to use it, we had adopted an ethical standard common to the barbarians of the Dark Ages. I was not taught to make war in that fashion, and wars cannot be won by destroying women and children.""

I have a feeling things like CGPT will be like the new Wiki for next generation of kids .,1
"This 1000000%! My first two years of high school were spent at what Texas called a 'magnet school' where they only accept some 300 kids a year, and teach classes normally reserved for colleges (we got college credit as well). Part of their philosophy was to treat students as adults, and as ""adults"" we were also expected to dress in business casual attire at least (which was interesting). 

In any case, the teachers took a completely different approach, especially my English and literate teacher. But even in my mathematics courses, we didn't just sit in rows and do homework. We had tables often arranged so that we could collaborate. We were encouraged to work together and communicate. We actively engaged each other in conversation, and helped each other with the work. The only tests we had were those required by the state. 

 I can honestly say I learned a thousand times more than during the second half of my high school career having been forced to move to Arizona with my family. Traditional educational teaching styles, especially in az, are a joke. Probably designed to do little more than prepare the majority of society for low paying jobs. It's not designed to educate it's designed to teach people to follow orders and keep in line.",3
that's not learning tho.,3
"I use it to provide outlines for essays or papers I need to write, as well as to point out any grammatical errors I might make. It helps me quite a bit to refine my writing, but it doesn't replace my own work in the slightest.

* Mostly Accurate: 49.43%
* Neutral: 23.63%
* Not Very Accurate: 6.31%
* Highly Inaccurate: 0.77%

From that data, over 80% are reporting that ChatGPT is at least somewhat inaccurate and over 30% actively saying it is not more accurate than it is inaccurate. The literal data they are presenting contradicts their conclusions from the data.",3
"> a tech bro gimmick

It isn't though. Not sure how anyone would think current LLMs are just gimmicks. I use it for coding, for generating summaries, drafting written materials, and much more. It's incredibly useful, and with techniques that allow it to re-process its own responses you can do amazing things.

Now, this is a general model. Versions of this model that were tuned for diagnostics exist, and they're better at detecting, diagnosing, and planning the treatment of many cancers. People who say this is all just a gimmick are huffing copium.",1

It's truly amazing how much it knows without internet access.",1
"From the paper:

>Prompts were input to the GPT-3.5-turbo-0301 model via the ChatGPT (OpenAI) interface.

Okay I get that the API for GPT-4 has only been available for a month or so to everyone, but Iâ€™m getting pretty tired of seeing the gpt-3.5 API model talked about as if it represents the latest technology. 

Their paper should instead be titled â€œUse of Previous Generation Artificial Intelligence Chatbots for Cancer Treatment Informationâ€

I know this is asking a lot from journalists these days, but they really should communicate things better and do better research. AI is advancing extremely fast, they need to actually compare these research papers that was started months ago with *recent* developments. 

GPT-4 is the current standard. Itâ€™s been available via premium ChatGPT for months, although researchers may not want to be limited by that interface/rate limits. I find it hard to believe OpenAI wouldnâ€™t give researchers a GPT-4 key if they asked. I got one within a week of it being announced and Iâ€™m just some guy.

Researchers who *have* used GPT4 to test its medical capabilities have seen a huge improvement.",1

"The Large Language Model Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race.

Joke aside, this caught my eye as being dogshit:
> # Survey Methods

> The survey collected insights from 10,000+ respondents from over 50 countries. Respondents were reached through Programiz.com, a programming website with an average monthly global traffic of 10 million visitors.

> The survey consisted of 39 questions, including five demographic questions. Respondents were asked about their programming background, the impact of ChatGPT on education and careers, and their future expectations. Thirty-two questions were close-ended, while seven were text-form questions for internal use â€” those seven questions and responses are omitted from this report.

> In summary, the Programiz survey employed a rigorous methodology, reaching a large and diverse respondent pool to uncover valuable insights into the impact of ChatGPT on programming education.

Were these questions presented uniformly across all visits? Were they presented uniformly across each demographic of visitor? Were statistics adjusted for demographic representation in the respondent pool? Were there any disparities in the translation of questions, or were they only presented in English to each demographic of visitor? Etc., etc..

I don't believe you can describe any methodology that is summed up in five sentences as ""rigorous"", and I'd argue the value of such polls are practically worthless, particularly when the target demographic is already biased towards independent learners with questionable commitment to education and experience. The survey itself claims that ""Excluding Programiz, Udemy, and Coursera are the top choices for learning programming"" - these platforms are notorious for providing ""edutainment"" content, which doesn't particularly instill confidence that the target demographic of this poll is particularly knowledgeable, which is largely backed up by the self report that ""Over 50% of respondents have under a year of coding experience"". This would lead me to believe that [the claim that ""only 6% of respondents found that the results from ChatGPT were inaccurate""](https://i.imgur.com/8rApykn.png) is not only objectively unreliable, but also a dogshit metric that means nothing because the respondent base of the poll doesn't know enough to discern bullshit from fact because ""Over 50% of respondents have under a year of coding experience"".

This is either incredibly harrowing or a monumental shitpost.",2
This is the way,1
I'm also getting the vibes of that anti-AI trend going on everywhere that seems purely reactionary.,1
"I don't want to encourage them to use it all the time...Yeah I see what you're saying with my comments. So I use it, and I'm also warry of it. But I know they also use chat gpt or other chat bots regularly. I want to discourage them from using it to cheat on essays and homework. So I recently started having them write in class on paper. But for their final project they can use it, but chat gpt alone won't be able to do the work ultimately they have to actually do it.",1

Most reasonable people would interpret ""military intervention"" as intervening with, and I know this might sound crazy but hear me out, intervening with the military.",2

"(my native language is Russian, I'm a language tutor,  translator and a copywriter)

 Creating exercises for my students to practice various grammar and vocabulary topics (""Create a fill in the blanc exercise to practice past simple and present perfect in contrast, on the topic ""summer holidays"", make 10 sentences, do not show answers""). Works pretty well, although requires corrections sometimes.


Explaining words. ""In the phrase ""..."", what does the word/phrase ""..."" mean?"". It understands context well, so it is much more useful than just looking up in the dictionary. It can also explain idioms and references. (Currently, i prefer Bing for this task, as having links to sources is important)


When I write in English, reviewing and correcting grammar, improving style. Finding synonyms to make the text sound more unique. Especially useful, when I need to write 100% unique text on the topic that was already discussed thousand times.


Via poe.com, I've created two bots for my students. One   makes ru-en and en-ru translations of word and phrases, commenting on the sentence structure (what does each part of a sentence mean and why this or that form is used) and giving simple examples for translated words.(when using existing online dictionaries, middle-schoolers often get overwhelmed with tons of examples and meanings they don't need right now). The second one is a conversation partner for language learners. It supports conversation on various topics, while giving feedback on mistakes in the student's input. Again, it is important that the feedback is given in the student's native language.


Random questions. When something like ""Why exactly do dogs enjoy fetching sticks?"" or ""Is it true that cemeteries are always colder?"" pops up in my head, I now have a place to get a quick answer.


(tested, working, currently not in active usage) Overcoming fear of a blank page. I'm trying to write fiction , and ChatGPT helps with idea generation very much, exactly what I need to bounce my ideas against. Do not need to bother loving people with my nonsense anymore.

I use it for my 1 credit hour lab that assigns us a 40 multiple choice question assignment a week that has nothing do to with the lab. The questions are also absurdly hard for no reason and canâ€™t even find the answers with like 1 minute of googling. Chat gpt do it easy,1
"At the end of the day, I think the issue is much deeper than AI.  In fact, AI like chat GPT is just forcing educators like yourself to address the real problem.  So, you could look at the rise of AI as an opportunity.

The real issue is that students aren't engaged in the learning process.  They view homework as a slog or necessary evil to get through school.  School shouldn't be a thing you get through.  It should be a formative experience that allows kids to better understand themselves and build confidence in their ability to live out their stand.  The fact that this is not the case is a strong indication that the current education methodologies are pathological.

What you will need to do is flip the script on this paradigm for your students.  You need to find a way to get them excited about writing.  Have them write about what interests them, no matter what it is.  Lean into what makes them feel alive and what excites them.  If you do this, and I'm not saying it will be easy, you can make the prospect of using AI to write for them undesirable.

Just some thoughts, good luck!",1

All it can do is select a word at a time that sounds functionally correct in the structure of the sentence. All these chat aiâ€™s do is add a few more variables to help the computer decide which word should go next. 

It doesnt have any idea what the sentences itâ€™s putting together mean though.. Just that they are functionally, grammatically correct, and resemble other existing sentences generated by humans under similar prompts.",3

"Considering that it was the US's goal to create a heavily armed, vehemently anti-Russian Israel-like state out of Ukraine, giving the AFU a clubbing certainly does improve their long term strategic position.   


Its certainly better than their option of doing nothing, which would have resulted a governmental crisis for not coming to aid to the breakaway regions.

"I guess it depends on what you're teaching, but I've found its still pretty good at taking lengthy technical documentation and rewriting for clarity, make it more concise, etc. Even though ChatGPT is getting a little a less useful/trustworthy each patch, it would still be a big benefit to your students to just have it as an on-call, 24/7 explanation bot.",2

I'm moreso amused by your choice to use slavery as an analogy for AI when it's THE mode of production the world won't let go of lol.

"I think old-school educators might not like it.  However, I think if youâ€™ve moved to a project-based curriculum, then you probably like it. Itâ€™s just a tool to accomplish some kind of learning objective. Gotta move away from memorization and more towards problem solving.",2
"It can explain how it found the solution, but it doesnt tell you *where* it found it, *who* it found it from. 

If you where to Google a Problem and the first apparent solution you found was some random facebook comment you probably would look further. ChatGPT probably wouldnt. 

I havent used it in a while, so maybe they solved the issues where it makes up nonsense. But the fact that this happened at all should always be a concern, as you also have to verify the axioms it is using. 

However, it probably is less of an issue if you are simply looking for commonly known or trivial things. There probably are enough high quality answers to be found that ChatGPT will give you the right one with context. 

Still, one should be careful, especially for beginners who are trying to learn. I would only recommend ChatGPT if you dont actually need it.",1

"This is spot on. At my uni, if we catch plagiarism the first thing we do is check the school to see if the person has done it before. If you do that in your first essay, you now have loads of assignments where you're marked as having plagiarised.

I also agree that the assignments we give early on are practice for when the grades really matter. I always get students panicking when the grades count and they spent the previous years not attending classes/taking time on their assignments.

I've marked literally thousands of essays. I always put the essay through ChatGPT to see what it looks like. I think, most of all, ChatGPT is terrible at engaging with the literature - the thing I'm assessing. If someone missed everything I've said to focus on, there's a serious issue.",2

"> A large part of the function of schools is as a connecting ground for  people - people come to school to find their place in the social groups  that will largely be the main opener of doors in their adult hood and  professional careers. 

I agree that networking in any setting will generally create a lot of potential ""door openers"", but it's definitely not the \*main\* reason that most people go to college.  Maybe things are a bit different for B.A. degrees, but B.S. degrees are radically different (atleast in my, albeit anecdotal, experience).  I lost contact with most everyone that I went to college with after about 3-4 years, and it's never provided me with a ""door-opener"".  So,  while I'll agree with the ""social networking"" aspect of it, I don't agree with your concept of ""social groups"" as a benefit.  


> A large part of the body of knowledge we possess concerns itself with  various modes of social interaction in the spheres of art, the  humanities, sociology, hisory, etc etc 

I don't have much experience with B.A. degrees, but of the people that I was friends with, I'd agree that social networking helped a lot of them find work after graduation.  Almost none of them actually work in the fields that they got their degree in (Psychology, Sociology, Anthropology, Art, Social Work, etc.).  


> You're right that colleges will have their place. Kids still need frat  parties, fresh perspectives, courtship etc - none of that is going away -  but what will go away is the popular belief that going to college means  you're smart and competent. How can it not once anyone can become a  temp worker in fields that used to take years of study just  by being  alert and having a chatgpt window open? 

ChatGPT is dangerous in that it is SO good at sounding correct.  It's fun to ping ideas off of, or use for creative tasks, but I would not trust it to do engineering work.  Nor would I trust someone with no experience to design something that people's lives depend on.  It will be a fantastic tool for people that already have experience in their field though (a doctor using it as a diagnosing tool - he'd have enough experience to tell if ChatGPT is incorrect or if he needed to drill down for better information).

I believe you're downplaying the other benefits of college (at least in a STEM field).",2

"Okay great, but you're the one who came at me saying I'm a problem because I successfully used GPT to build something. Like I said, I'm not your problem, people who have been able to get productive use out of it are not your problem. GPT does make errors but it can recognize and correct their errors, pretty fast I might say. GPT can be useful as long as you use it right. It's not a cure all and can't simply write up a working program. But, it can write up small blocks of code that you can use to build up your product.",1

They're not very good at using Google. They misinterpret information or don't read it carefully. In the case of an writing software, it'll often bring up stuff we never talked about or write above the students ability. 

I always bring up answers to the tests and let students grade them as well. Point out some of the silly errors and show them how I know they just relied on Google. Ai is similar.",1

On the other hand, being self taught proves you had self-iniciative, motivation, and resourcefulness to learn everything on your own.

Who would you rather hire? A college gradute with no projects or someone who is self taught but has a dozen projects on google play?

What you said is true. It was already possible to learn everything on your own before AI. From my experience I can say it was already easier, faster and cheaper, than going to college.

"When people did math in school before calculators, they were given a task that would take them maybe 10h by hand. When the calculator was invented, the answer was not to do the same assignment as before, but now in 30 min. Instead, the way math evolved was to give students a new assignment that took 10h to complete, with a calculator. Move the focus of the learning from manual labor to understanding the concept. 

I would think of assignments that before ChatGPT was impossible for a student to complete, and see if they now, with the use of GPT can be done. 

I'm thinking of things like ""Write a full book"", because that is very likely something that would not be possible before. But since ChatGPT is creating 80% of the book, it is not possible. But on the way the students can learn about all the steps it takes for a writer to take a small idea and expand it into a full book. How to start writing an outline, and then expand that outline into a full story etc.",1

"> Later on, weâ€™ll look inside this neural net, and talk about how it works. But for now we can just apply this â€œnet modelâ€ as a black box to our text so far, and ask for the top 5 words by probability that the model says should follow: 

yes, you can call a single function that asks it to just predict the next single word, but it's not the only way it operates. Also, this is using GPT2, a way simpler model than GPT4 that worked more like a markov chain, by predicting single words

later in the article, it explains it better

>With sufficiently much English text we can get pretty good estimates not just for probabilities of single letters or pairs of letters (2-grams), but also for longer runs of letters. And if we generate â€œrandom wordsâ€ with progressively longer n-gram probabilities, we see that they get progressively â€œmore realisticâ€:

>But letâ€™s now assumeâ€”more or less as ChatGPT doesâ€”that weâ€™re dealing with whole words, not letters. There are about 40,000 reasonably commonly used words in English. And by looking at a large corpus of English text (say a few million books, with altogether a few hundred billion words), **we can get an estimate of how common each word is. And using this we can start generating â€œsentencesâ€, in which each word is independently picked at random, with the same probability that it appears in the corpus. Hereâ€™s a sample of what we get:**

>**Not surprisingly, this is nonsense. So how can we do better?** Just like with letters, we can start taking into account not just probabilities for single words but probabilities for pairs or longer n-grams of words. Doing this for pairs, here are 5 examples of what we get, in all cases starting from the word â€œcatâ€:

>Itâ€™s getting slightly more â€œsensible lookingâ€. And we might imagine that if we were able to use sufficiently long n-grams weâ€™d basically â€œget a ChatGPTâ€â€”in the sense that weâ€™d get something that would generate essay-length sequences of words with the â€œcorrect overall essay probabilitiesâ€. 

also worth noting that in the secon part i quoted it's approaching the problem of predicting letters with simple statistics

> A very minimal thing we could do is just take a sample of English text, and calculate how often different letters occur in it. So, for example, this counts letters in the Wikipedia article on â€œcatsâ€: 

this is not using the actual model, it's just enumerating letter probabilities in a wikipedia article

it's explaining the initial approach of general text prediction starting from predicting single letters and stepping up the complexity until

> we can start taking into account not just probabilities for single words but probabilities for pairs or longer n-grams of words. And we might imagine that if we were able to use sufficiently long n-grams weâ€™d basically â€œget a ChatGPTâ€â€”in the sense that weâ€™d get something that would generate essay-length sequences of words with the â€œcorrect overall essay probabilitiesâ€.

">policy do you recommend for k-12 schools to implement regarding AI generation? Are there any ways teachers can prevent students from cheating using it--for example, having it write essays for them

k-12 education critically depends on using writing to help students learn how to think. Since AI text generation is impossible to block, even if you block it on a school network, We might need to reconsider our methods for teaching students how to think. In STEM education, we adapted to the abacus, the slide rule, the arithmetic calculator, the scientific calculator, the graphic calculator, and Mathematics software - we did that by reconsidering pedagogical priorities. AI text generation is a deeper problem, I think, but the same principle applies. If our aim is teaching students how to think, ask how we did that before the printing press. It was largely through orality, from verbal reasoning to environmental observation. There ARE other ways to discharge are scared duty to our students, including teaching them how to think.

"There are some fields like medicine that do still require hands-on training. However, the reality is that the number of people studying to become a doctor is minimal in comparison to the number of people studying other university programs and it is incredibly difficult to even gain admission. Many universities do not even offer medical degrees either.

A big component of being a doctor is spending time talking to patients and providing diagnosis. There are already some studies showing that AI can do a better job than humans at some medical tasks. I do believe it is then possible that there might not be the same need for doctors in the future, especially when considering that developed countries are already or soon will have declining populations.",3
"I think of them as a response to modern society requiring youth to go tens of thousands into debt, spend hundreds of hours on school, to exit and make $50k a year that makes very little use of their education. Employers demanding education levels irrelevant to the actual job (do you really need a university degree do be an office admin?). And employers just want it, because everyone has a degree now. 

So force people to pay 10s of k per year on university they donâ€™t need, and they may never be able to even afford a house afterwards. So they need to work while in school, to avoid going into debt, so they donâ€™t have time to work to survive AND do the (mostly) bullshit assignments.

I certainly hope doctors and people who actually need what they are taught donâ€™t do this, but a lot of what you have to do in university to get the degree, to get the job, doesnâ€™t have a ton of actual relevance to what you do in your career. 

Automated paper writing seems like a response and backlash to an increasingly untenable situation we are putting the next generations in.

-Creating Exams:
Create exam style questions, quotes tests, Q's with overly convoluted language the students have to crack etc.

It was even able to create a step-by-step process for the judge to run the activity. 

-Live during Classes:
I've used it to show students the impact small changes make. Get GPT to create a generic piece of writing that is intentionally boring or monotone. Get the class to make suggestion on how it could be made better and implement them live on the board. The class will slowly alter and improve the text while observing the impact of their changes in real time. 

-Providing Feedback on essays:
It's not great at giving a specific grade, but GPT is good at suggestion how to improve your work and re-writing samples to reflect these suggestions. 

-Essay Plans
When people are stuck for ideas GPT is really useful for providing sample plans. It's useful for seeing the big picture and getting an idea of the variety of points that could be made to tackle any question. You can always ask for more detail if the initial brainstorming is too vague.",1

">write a Cron expression that runs every 2 weeks on a Tuesday

Did you ask GPT-3.5? I just asked 4, and it said:

>A cron expression that runs every 2 weeks on a Tuesday can be set up using two separate expressions. You cannot achieve it with just one cron expression due to how the cron system works.  
>  
>Here are two expressions, one for every first Tuesday and the other for every third Tuesday of the month:

    # First Tuesday of every 2 weeks (1st and 15th day of the month)
    0 0 1-7,15-21 * 2
    
    # Third Tuesday of every 2 weeks (8th and 22nd day of the month)
    0 0 8-14,22-28 * 2

EDIT: I've literally never worked with cron jobs before, but I asked it to explain those statements, and I realized it was wrong. These two will run *every* tuesday, so I told it that, and it said:

>Apologies for the confusion in my earlier response. You are correct that combining those two expressions would result in the job running every Tuesday rather than every two weeks. To achieve a cron expression that runs every two weeks on a Tuesday, you can use the following approach:

"Iâ€™ve found it to be very useful for 
1. Programming. Especially improving iteratively upon existing code. Or explaining what certain sections of code do. 
2. Cutting through parts of Google that have become mired in SEO-optimized sites with tons of ads. For example, when I want to cook something I donâ€™t usually cook, I ask GPT to give me a quick X recipe. Normally recipe sites are designed with a ton of ads and force you to scroll forever just to find the ingredient list and instructions. All the top recipe hits on Google results are designed this way because theyâ€™ve been catering to a world where people Google everything. Now itâ€™s so much easier. ChatGPT, tell give me a quick recipe for a fried chicken sandwich. Chicken tagine. Cardamom blondies. Anything really, it just gives you a list of ingredients and steps you need to do. No scrolling. No ads. Expand this from cooking to most things you would normally Google for instructions. 
3. Summarizing complicated things into laymanâ€™s terms. For example, reading a patent application and telling me in more basic terminology what something does. 

I feel like Iâ€™m still finding new uses for ChatGPT every few days. Auto-GPT could be another revolution but Iâ€™m having a hard time setting it up. But itâ€™s still new to me. But honestly, I do think ChatGPT will replace Google as the place people go to for answers and solutions to things.",1

"The biggest difference is that you can ask follow up questions. For example: I'm not a professional developer, but I work in cybersecurity and sometimes I get a malware sample that I can't identify. I work with chatgpt to try and figure it out, and while it certainly doesn't get everything right the first time, what seperates it from google/stackoverflow is that I can say ""hey that didn't work, this is the error I got"", or ""that's a good theory, but I don't think that it fits in this case because of x"", and then it can take that new information into account and try again. And in my experience we're always able to get there eventually. 


And that's just something that's not really possible in real time with Google or stackoverflow. You either have to find something that *exactly* fits your situation, or you have to post yourself and wait hours/days to get responses to every possible follow up question you may have. 


I think that's the issue with the kinds of tests that people use to show that it's bad. Sure, you can throw a problem and it and it may solve it wrong. But in the real world, when it's a real problem you're trying to solve, how long it actually takes is more important than how many revisions it takes to get there. Sometimes if I need a quick script for something in a language I'm not strong in, I can ask chatgpt, and yeah it's first attempt might not be perfect, but I can say ""Hey this doesn't work"" or ""Hey I'd prefer if it worked like this"" and it can give you a second, third, fourth revision extremely quickly.  


Also, chatgpt just got internet access a few days ago, allowing it to actually look up new sources rather than just whatever is in its predefined dataset, and it's going to gradually start rolling out to everyone soon, so I expect that to be another pretty big upgrade in it's functionality.",3

"This is such a joke. The US undermined democracy at every opportunity. Look up Operation Condor. 

Social Democracy, when voted for by the local populace, is democracy. In the 1950s and 1960s, The US took the position that social democracy = communism (The Nordic model is an example of social democracy).

As such:

* US toppled Juan Jose Torres for convening an Assembly of the People in Bolivia and installed the Banzer Dictatorship.
* The US installed Jorge Rafael Videla in Argentina (author of state terrorism that led to 30k extrajudicial political murders + concentration camps) and brought about The Dirty War
* Overturned the democratic election of Salvador Allende in 1970 and installed Augosto Pinochet as dictator (you know the war criminal responsible for the execution of thousands and internment of 80k)
* Funded a right-wing CIA coup in Ecuador after Joe Maria Velasco Ibarra refused to break relations with Cuba. Their replacement for Ibarra was less friendly, so they overthrew him and installed a military junta in his place.
* Overthrew Jacobo Arbenz after his popular election in Guatemala. Arbenz had come under the ire of the United Fruit Company (a company chaired and owned by the Dulles brothers, John Foster and Allen - US Secretary of State and director of the CIA respectively) for Decree 900, an initiate aimed at buying back the 2/3rds of the country owned by UFCO and redistributing it to Guatemalans. The US backed a coup by Castillo Armas via military and aerial support, which led to the toppling of the leftist and popularly elected government. this ushered in the Guatemalan Civil War, which resulted in the Silent Holocaust - 300k Mayans were executed and buried in mass graves by US-trained far-right wing troops using Israeli weapons.

Nicaragua, Panama, Venezuela, Haiti, DR, Peru have copious other examples of US-undermining democracy. Open a non-propaganda based textbook PLEASE",2

Well, The federal minimum wage hasn't really changed much and we have robots in McDonald's now, self checkout lanes and markets, etc.
My point is that I hear what you're saying. I agree with you that it is anti worker (skilled and unskilled), and a disruptive force. If companies, school systems, even individuals can pay less, they absolutely will. They'll even take the cut in quality if they can just get by with it. In a way, teaching already does this by grinding through new and first-year teachers for low pay rather than create efforts to keep the more experienced and skilled ( but more expensive) teachers around. What I'm saying is that a boycott is probably not going to cut it.

Besides all the good ideas that I see here, including getting rid of homework or flipping the classroom, there needs to be an organized response from administrators, unions, the government on how disruptive technology will be impacting education.  Because we can all (besides the crazies)agree that there are negative impacts along with the positive, we can't just leave it to teachers to have to figure out how to deal with those impacts in a thousand different ways.

I see so many paths for improvement in AI, better hardware, bigger models, more complicated models, combining models, more data, better training methods, AI optimizing these things itself.

Additionally, since chatgpt became big, a ton of new people/researchers and resources have now been poured into this field so the speed at which new findings will emerge should increase.

>Because when you research, or memorize times tables, or do any sort of reading, writing or math on your own, you're learning.

"Lacking any serious computer science skills, I use it to test the validity of my arguments on essays and response prompts.  Mind you, I've always wanted to be an author so I don't use it to write anything for me as that would defeat the purpose of self-expression. However, it's all-too-easy to not evaluate our arguments objectively as we are the ones who made them.

I start by explaining the purpose of the prompt and it's context, provide GPT with the prompt, then provide whatever text I want evaluated. I never tell GPT that the text is my own or whomever's for the sheer possibility it presents user bias. Typically it finds my reasoning consistently sound, every now and then we get into discussions if I feel it needs further context, but once it absolutely shredded a point I was trying to make to the point I swapped out the topic of that paragraph with a different one that it evaluated as more fitting - thankfully that swap was already one I had on backup so I didn't feel like it provided me the angle.",3

Again, man, you seem to be confused about what the topic is. We're not discussing, ""Will I know the kid cheated?""
  
  
We're discussing, ""What can we do about it when there is little to no actionable evidence and admin and parents won't support teachers who hand out zeros because we 'know' the kid cheated?""
  
  
That's the question. You can either keep dodging it or admit that it's a real problem and help solve it.",3

What exactly am I coping about since your trying to turn the tables on me? Can you elaborate? Like my god just don't sign up for the class if you won't attend it, it's your own money you're wasting. 

You can literally do what OP did by just using google, in the same amount of time, especially when it's such a basic class.

"Any new innovation will have the 2% who make use of it, the 15% who enjoy it but can't figure out what to do with it really and even the vast majority who might oppose it due to fear of change.

It took decades for cars to wipe out the vast majority of horses and to turn the 80%+ of farm workers into the 10% or so it is today. ChatGPT has been around for a few days and it is train-wrecking economies around the globe. 

If anyone would read this i would say we should keep our eye on this: to see how poorly humans adapt to life-altering innovations. We are well past the stage of 'waiting for Steve Jobs' - relying on innovations to have the marriage of technology and customer-comprehension magically married for the proletariat. We are in for something different - and next year it will be a *vastly better* kind of different.",1

"Which kind of defeats the purpose, in a way. Even if I had one conversation I used solely for genealogical data, it isn't handling that data any differently from any other text it uses.

I tried asking in what year Thomas ws 30 years old, and got this:

>Me: What year was Thomas 30 years old?  
ChatGPT: To determine the year Thomas was 30 years old, we can subtract 30 from the year of his birth. However, we don't have Thomas's birth year. Do you have any other information or context that could help me answer this question more accurately?

This was in the same conversation where I had given the birth date before, in several pieces of information.

It isn't really any kind of assistant. If I have to use some special format to give it information, I might as well use a real genealogical database.",2

">code of ethics play in the progression of AI regarding employment outlooks

I think the economic prognosticators who predict widespread economic disruption due to AI technologies are probably correct, but that can be good news as well as bad news. For one thing, remote work is becoming more widespread so the traditional disruptions of outsourcing won't apply here to the same degree. For another thing, from what I hear, working in typing pool wasn't that much fun, and the end of typing pools might have been a good thing on the whole. Typing got done by word processors and the typists - mostly women, by the way - migrated to more interesting jobs. In the same way, tedious text-production tasks can be handled by GPTs, freeing talent to work on other tasks. AI text production has the capability of disrupting moderate-to-high-paying jobs, such as teachers, where GPTs will doubtless be able to create better lectures, with better illustrations, than tired and tech-deficient humans. I'm intrigued by the idea that a new technology can disrupt an economic system from the middle outwards, instead of messing with the lives of the most vulnerable. It's a nice change of pace given the way the last two centuries have gone. Perhaps those teachers displaced from routine lecturing tasks will invest their time in small group conversations, returning to orality to hone student thinking skills.

On your second question, ask ChatGPT. Seriously.",2

The second everyone is used to AI bots writing 'the boring' writing, someone will ask, 'well, if it can do that, why not use it to write novels? Non-fiction? In fact, why not just get it to handle all the writing?' 

Everything is going to change, and though I can't stop it, I do at least want people to think about what they're doing. I do at least want them to understand what their support of this will do to the world. Goodbye English Lit and Lang as subjects of meaningful study, for one. Goodbye the concept of 'the author'.

Well, I do think itâ€™s a bit worse than that, yeah :p

"It builds entire coding projects. I haven't coded since the nineties and I'm making complex projects with gpt-4. It spits out entire finished files.

It even debugs. Just paste the code in, then paste the error in, then tell it to fix it and give you the code.

I also use it to clean up and shrink code down, or to comment code I already have so I understand what it does. It's wild what I've already accomplished. Coding is becoming a game you can play if you can speak or type about what you want clearly in regular old English.

In the last few days I've used it to build my own little auto-gpt that runs fully locally with llama (or openai if you want) and a local embedding solution... and it did all the coding. It even self improved its own code because I allowed it to...

If I was teaching a high school or middle school coding class, I'd be using chatgpt to do it, and the kids would be using chatgpt to complete the work :). Teach them to work in modules and to tack them into their main project. Each file is a module that fits chatgpt's context window.",1

Nevertheless, I see this as a thing we need to be vigilant about, but we need to remember that the point of essays is the kids showing they're thinking, not producing an essay. Kids can show their thinking in a variety of ways and if you want them to write an essay and don't want a chance of an AI generated one, have them write it in class, or require that they write in a Google document that shows ALL of their history. 

Plus this creates interesting questions to ponder",1

"Not OP but Iâ€™m using ChatGPT4 a lot right now. I am an experienced software developer but am relatively new to Python. I find that the best approach is to just start chatting away. I start with a high level outline of what Iâ€™m trying to do. Provide as much detail as you can and even reference other sites for what you are trying to achieve. ChatGPT will most likely respond with an outline of how to approach the problem and depending on context, may even give you some code. Then just start asking questions about what it told you. Donâ€™t have Python installed? Ask it how to install it. Donâ€™t know how to use virtual environments? Ask it what they are and how to use them. Donâ€™t know how to install other libraries. Ask it. Donâ€™t know how to use VSCode? Tell it you have no clue and need to know how to start. Finally getting a script to run but getting an error? Copy and paste the error into ChatGPT and ask why the error is happening. Want to put your code in GitHub but have no clue what to do? Tell ChatGPT that you have no clue. 

You still have to know a lot about what you want to accomplish with your code and how you should manage everything but as long as you can keep prompting ChatGPT with good context, it will guide you through what to do. Itâ€™s kind of like having a super patient experienced developer that will take the time and answer the most stupid and basic questions. Over and over again. 

Granted, you still need to double check the code and make sure it is correct and does what you want, but even when it is wrong, it is usually very close and it will often introduce ways of doing things that you hadnâ€™t known or thought of. Especially in Python.

Update: I posed your question to ChatGPT and had a nice little conversation with it on your behalf: https://chat.openai.com/share/2f19aa14-e8d2-41a0-b98c-8819f6f36d6b

Read it and dive in!",1
"Iâ€™ve seen this sentiment a few times. I understand but I donâ€™t think itâ€™s the right approach. Instead of banning or ignoring AI, teachers, parents, and kids need to work together to make it useful for learning. 

I work in tech and we are expected to use chatGTP at every level of the company- marketing, sales, engineering, dev, customer support. 

The more experience and knowledge students can get now will only help them in a future career, whatever it is. 

Iâ€™ve also used it in doing math homework with my teen. We had a problem neither of us could figure it out. Using chatGPT we had all the steps to understand and solve the problem and apply the concept to other similar questions. 

Students who understand how to use these tools to be more efficient will have a key advantage when they enter the workforce.",1
"Iâ€™d be curious if you focused for 1 week on how to break down problems and define solutions like a software architect and then gave them GPT access again if their experiences would improve.

"As someone pointed out here, most people don't like text at all.  (YouTube is much more popular than books).

"Cheating is a problem and AI text detectors such as GPTZero probably won't work well for much longer as AT text generation improves. The solution there is to devise ways otf teaching students how to think that don't depend so heavily on writing. But my students are excited about the possibilities of GPTs as conversation partners. In that case, the skill has everything to do with querying AIs in intelligent ways. That's a very important form of learning that depends on a kind of empathy, understanding how AIs really work. Eliciting relevant information from AIs is not always easy and young people need to learn how to do it.",2

I believe that technology has the potential to enhance education and make learning more accessible to people around the world.

Had I actually memorized those tables back in the day, that would not help with daily math where the numbers are stuff like 40kg x .3ml.",3
"I don't see it as cheating. I see it as using a tool to simplify your workload. The reason I liken it to a calculator, is because similar to a calculator, you can simply tell it ""I need you to do this."" and it does all the work.

For many things it works perfectly fine as a ""search engine"" to get some basic information for further research.

Like I was sitting in an Airbus 320 the other day, and the engines looked differently to what I'm used to. The ""hull"" (not an English native so didn't know how you would call that) went all the way back while I'm being used to engines where it stops about 3/4 the way back.

"At work, I've found a way to save valuable time when dealing with Change  Request tickets. 

Instead of spending excessive time crafting these  tickets manually, I leverage the power of GitHub Copilot in Visual  Studio Code.

This not only speeds  up the process significantly but also allows me to focus on more  impactful tasks. After the initial draft, I customize the details as  needed and confirm its accuracy, making the entire workflow more  efficient and freeing up time for higher-leverage activities.

    C. Implementation Plan

"As a follow-up, I tried asking ChatGPT (after it gave me the biography based on the facts, so still in the same conversation), what year Thomas and Hazel might have married. I got: ""Based on the information given that Hazel was born in 1945 and they got married in 1966, they would have married in the year 1966.""

Now, the 1930 census indicates age at first marriage (24 for Hazel, and probably 30 for Thomas), so I would have expected it to make use of that. I'm not sure where the 1945 and 1966 came from, as those weren't anywhere in the data I provided.

I told ChatGPT they married before their oldest child was born (that was in 1932), so then it said: ""I apologize for my mistake earlier. Without further information, it is difficult to determine the exact year when Hazel and Thomas got married. However, if their oldest child was born in 1953 and assuming that the parents were at least 18 years old when they had their child, Hazel and Thomas could have married sometime in the early to mid-1950s.""

So it is pretty awful at synthesizing information that was provided to it.",2

"Your last point is exactly what I'm imagining it as a solution to... Some quote about the victors being the historians, or something. For the rest... I think you might be reading too much into what I was saying (+semantics)... All I meant was (if used, and used correctly) it would resolve a good percentage of the occurrences of the two specific problems, but not all of them... And not all problems.

I agree that historians bring their own biases, assumptions, and interpretations to their work, which shape the way they construct narratives. That feels similar to the argument that artists make about not being threatened because what they're selling is the story behind the artist and work, not just colors on paper. That seems like another discussion...

... But if you use my previous analogy and consider it as just another human's biases, assumptions, and interpretations that can be generated without limit, the concern wouldn't be whether or not a human's biases are a more pure form of history. You'd just be in the same boat as the artists: needing to prove that your history is better generated history with better (human) weights and biases.

If we back up a bit and get a much rougher, but maybe more llm friendly, perspective... History exists via words, which is apparently why the time before writing systems existed is called prehistory (thanks Wikipedia ""History"" page's second sentence). LLMs are pretty good with words, they can create both fiction and non-fiction that passes the Turing test via millions of people. So I expect LLMs to impact any job that involves word. Worrying about whether or not theoretical subjective concepts are being truly internalized by the system won't stop it from copy/pasting your artwork... But another subject worthy of discussion.

Fair warning, further responses may be generated by chatgpt. Hehe [http://puu.sh/JCzl2.png](http://puu.sh/JCzl2.png)",3
"I actually had GPT generate a story in the style of *The Trial* but in the modern day and with a small business owner up against a social media company. What it came up with pretty much exactly mirrored my own experience with Facebook *and* was a passable imitation of Kafka.

I think explicitly embracing AI is the way to go. It's not going anywhere. AI detection tools are a dead end - they're inherently not viable. It's even less winnable a fight than copy protection.

You might have a bit of a learning curve at first figuring out how to structure the assignments when ChatGPT's capabilities and behavior keep changing on a weekly basis but you'll just have to be flexible.

I think one potentially interesting approach would be to give the students the job of catching GPT's mistakes. This is something that bypasses the cheating issue *and* is going to be a critical skill for using AI properly.

You can export chats now, so students can show their work. In my experience, the longer you pursue any topic with GPT in one session, the more likely it is to start hallucinating. Have them keep pressing until they catch it garbling a narrative or just making things up. This is an opportunity for critical reading and fact checking.

What I love about GPT is that it can be a perfectly-tailored tutor. I've never taken more than high school biology but I'm a science enthusiast and I'll start watching videos on molecular biology and have questions I can't easily google, and I can explain to GPT where I'm at and what I want to know and it explains things at an appropriate level, and clarifies on request. But of course it also makes things up so I have to go and check its answers. IMHO *that* is what you want students doing. Get them using it as a tool that takes them out to the edge of their knowledge and abilities, and teach them how to verify what they're learning.",1
"Even while I had math teachers telling me that, I knew it wasn't true I have always had access to a calculator whenever I needed it, The awesome thing for me was in grade 12 my math teacher was well aware of the fact that most people have a calculator in their pockets and allowed me to program my graphing calculator to perform every equation that he had taught, as to him it meant that I must have understood the equations if I was able to write an application to perform each calculation while only providing a small sample of input values",3
"It's *really* easy to tell what is AI generated if it's a lazy student. My master's courses require me to peer review papers and the ones that just copy/paste are freakishly similar. They all use similar words and structure. Another dead giveaway is they all use almost identical sources, but they are always on rephrase, not direct quote. If you double check the source, it's never directly relevant to the paraphrase it's attached to. 


Is there a way to prove it undoubtedly? No. Which is why there isn't a way to enforce. But it's SO obvious and makes the student look like an idiot. At least make an effort to add some personality to it and use relevant resources.",3

AI is about to destroy the current system of education and I am personally overjoyed.

"I agree with this 100%. This sort of thing creates abstractions around problems to a degree that critical thinking is no longer necessary, for a large amount of tasks.  

  

I view this sort of similarly to cloud computing / virtualization (in concept). We've abstracted so much of ""how a computer works"" , ""how a network works"", that those managing technology infrastructure have no clue how it really works under the hood.  I think there must be a balance that we strike between, or we will just succumb to the convenience of having AI do everything for us.",2

"Thanks for the question, kg\_from\_ct. It is a complicated issue for educational institutions. We want our students to learn how to think, and writing has been an important tool for teaching students to think. GPTs threaten that arrangement, obviously. But there may be ways to teach students to think other than focusing on writing. And our students really need to learn how to make use of GPTs, which aren't going anywhere. We can't ban GPTs without letting our students down, and we can't allow unrestricted use without harming student learning processes. Something in between sounds wise to me.",2

"Couldnâ€™t resist :: The flaws in the logic presented are as follows:

1. The conclusion that generative AI is not a world-shaking revolution is based solely on the percentage of US adults who find ChatGPT significantly useful. This overlooks the broader impact and potential of generative AI beyond ChatGPT alone.

2. The study's findings focus on the current adoption and perception of ChatGPT among US adults. It does not necessarily reflect the entire landscape of generative AI or its future development. Drawing broad conclusions about the entire field based on a single application is not accurate.

3. The notion of something being ""revolutionary"" is subjective and depends on various factors such as context and long-term effects. While the study's findings suggest limited adoption and impact of ChatGPT, it doesn't necessarily negate the possibility of generative AI having revolutionary implications in other domains or over a longer time frame.

It's important to consider that technology adoption and societal impact often take time to unfold fully. Assessing the potential of generative AI requires a broader examination of its applications, advancements, and the evolving perspectives of experts in the field.",1
"Congrats on conflating 'cheating on coursework' with 'cheating the broken education system while dealing with mental health issues'.

"u/ok_student_3292 I know you wrote this bullshit 9 months ago, but you absolutely DONâ€™T know when someone turns in generated text.

I use it from time to time to write little scripts for my devops work. A lot of times it's wrong, and I have to use my own knowledge to correct it. Sometimes it's a good tool to lay out a foundation of a script I need, and flesh it out from there on my own",1
"I'm a novice when it comes to coding, and recently I've been using GPT to help make a code for me for my job that can extract data from . CSV files, convert them to . XLSX, and create scatter plots with some customization.

"You are the only one calling them animals.  Having a high morale for your country is very noble in my eyes, even if they were the perpetrator of vast evil deeds across their region.

"What are you talking about? The point of writing a speech is to express your ideas on the subject that you learned in a clear and concise manner. It's an extension of whatever field you're working in. So lets say you're an engineer and you developed a great idea on how to improve solar panels. You have to be able to use all your knowledge and put it into words so that others get drawn to the idea and appreciate it. You can't just ask AI to use your knowledge and formulate it in such a way that makes it appealing to others, at least yet. That's one of the purposes of a speech class. You have to actually think of the important points that you want to emphasize, how to lay them out, how to make it interesting etc. If one day the AI is capable of not just going off a prompt, but taking all your points that you plugged and researched and simply coming up with a nice way to string them together, then it would be more like a calculator - you've done the actual research and have all the details and the AI just makes it sound pretty - but here it's completely different - the AI comes up with all the points, it comes up with all the points of emphasis, all of the logic etc. In other words you're not going to be able use it in a professional context. Which is the whole point of a speech class - to teach you how to express your own ideas on paper and how to present them properly.",2
"To add on: memory is, indeed, finite. We forget/store information we donâ€™t normally use and later on in life have difficulties recalling said information unless something helps us remember. The things we remember the most are things we do frequently in our lives (our job skills, our daily routines, hobbies, etc.). 

With this in mind: not having to waste memory space on calculations frees up our brains to perform other tasks. While we may begin to forget how some of these calculations work as we begin doing them ourselves less and less, as you said on your other post: we will gain much more efficiency as we will have extra time freed up to focus on other problems/tasks while our AI takes care of the calculations. 

Just like the calculator changed how we do math, AI will have its own positives and negatives as it gets more and more introduced to our society. I think the positives will outweigh the negatives for the most part.",1

"I'm sure an algorithm could be programmed to make detection difficult. However, human handwriting is typically sloppy and inconsistent--it's easy to tell that this was made by a robot because of things like:

* The margins are very precise and even at the edges of the paragraph.

* The letters of the same type are all the same

* The orientation of the letters themselves are always consistent; you don't see some letters facing at slightly different angles, which happens as your hand moves across the page. 

The small imperfections in normal human handwriting would make this paper stand out to any basic criticism. Things like trying to squeeeeze the words into the margin of the paper before you start a new line or just simple mistakes which you need to cross out (they are using a pen, after all).",3
"I'd say it's more read comprehension? I haven't messed around with chatbots that much, but for art at least a lot of it is being able to guess how other people on the internet might describe something, so the AI is able to understand what you want.

When I first heard of ChatGPT and how it worked, it seemed to me like a great way to get a first draft, but you'd always have to treat what it produces as a first draft by someone who doesn't really know the topic, and was just pulling together information; it couldn't judge accuracy or consistency.

"Thanks for being a good sport.  In all seriousness:

20 years ago I was a top student in a gifted program, but my family was poor and anti-intellectual, and we knew nothing of college preparedness.  I attended several local colleges and a state university and was dismayed to feel that I was somehow being ripped off.

The classes I attended were massive, the books were expensive and the debt was crippling.  I largely taught *myself* from these books; the lectures seemed to be low effort summaries of what I learned without help.  There was little to no personal attention paid to students.  Despite skyrocketing tuition the value of the education seemed to exist solely in the interactions and collaboration with other students.

I dropped out to self study computer science.  Though anecdotal, I have led an intellectually gratifying life.  It has been financially and intrinsically rewarding.  I still keep up with cutting edge research in my spare time.  I have maintained a grudge and a bias against the extant incentive structure of higher education and the social pressures that maintain it, and welcome any disruption to the sweeping injustice we commit against young and naive who are funneled through undergraduate programs without regard to personal cost.  Graduate school is widely regarded in my industry as a pyramid scheme, and tenure is a relic of the past.

What role will university play in a future where every person may access personalized AI tutors, vast repositories of accumulated human knowledge and can communicate directly with students across the globe?  Why should I worry about the ethics of students unfairly getting ahead in a system that, to me, seems largely unethical as a whole?",2

"I use gpt to learn languages. I have it translate a sentence for me and then go into a conversation about each aspect of the sentence that I don't understand.  

Ex. Why did you use this word instead of another one? Why is there a preposition used here that doesn't have an English equivalent? Why did you use the infinitive when the English uses the present participle? Why did you change to passive voice rather than active?, etc.

Does it sometimes give me answers that are confusing or even wrong? Yes. But because it explains the concepts, when that happens I usually pick up on the fact that the examples that it gives me don't match the concept that it's explaining, and I ask it to clarify. It then either corrects itself or explains it to me in a different way. It will never get frustrated or tired of me asking questions, and I don't spend hours looking for a grammar answer that I can't find. If it's wrong about something and I don't catch it, I will eventually figure that out in the normal course of study, but in the meantime, I don't have to just wait until a course ""gets to that step"" in order to learn something that I'm curious about now.

And if you have an important written deliverable, you can run the text through CGPT to check for flow, grammar, etc. It's kinda dumb where you really wish it were smart -like I can't get it to analyze my health symptoms- but it can also be a great aid in cranking out certain types of dreaded, soul-sucking documents.",1

They then typed in â€œlakemichigan.com.â€ The webpage that it brought up was full of erroneous facts like â€œLake Michigan is in Oklahoma.â€ They asked us if that fact was true and we all said no because we lived in Michigan and knew where Lake Michigan was. The lesson was for us to know that we canâ€™t go to dogs.com to find the best information about dogs and that you must look critically at the information you find on the internet because much of it can be demonstrably false.

"I have some concerns,

1. ChatGPT is known to ""hallucinate."" That is the euphemism for when it gets things wrong. Unfortunately, it is built in such a way that the false information sounds correct. In other words, it is [a very good bullshitter](https://www.reasonfieldlab.com/post/chatgpt-the-revolutionary-bullshit-parrot).
2. ChatGPT is basically a black box. One doesn't have any idea how it came up with what it did. This transparency is crucial to building trust in it.
3. ChatGPT is subject to data poisoning. You can affect what comes out of it by feeding it data with different slants. There are several really good articles out there about this.
4. It works best with highly structured data. Things like programming languages, sentences, etc. That is because as an LLM, it is literally guessing what the next word should be in its response with very little understanding of what the subject is actually about. (See item 1)
5. We are in the middle of a super-hype cycle. We have been here many times before. Before we rush to let an extremely new discipline educate us, let's give it some time to mature. At first I thought it was just people in IT, but it turns out everyone is attracted to shiny new things without understanding them. We seem to be afraid that someone else will get ahead and wreck our hopes and ambitions.

I think the six month pause is a good idea, but unrealistic. Before we turn over something as important as education to it, I would prefer for it to be a bit more proven. The people the most vocal for it tend to have the least knowledge on it. It is almost an act of faith.",1

"I teach programming to slightly older teenagers and ChatGPT is truly terrible for learning. Sure, it *can* be used to improve learning, but that's *not* how students use it. Also, ChatGPT *can* certainly be used when working a real job but that's *not* relevant for the learning process.

A bunch of comments seems to say that you should make the tasks more difficult to account for the help ChatGPT is giving but that's not how learning works. Having someone else solve simple problems for you doesn't prepare you for solving difficult problems.

It's just like with the calculator.. So many people going ""when I went to school the teacher said we had to learn arithmetic because I wouldn't always have a calculator in my pocket, but now we do so ChatGPT is okay!"". No. The teacher said that because it was an easy way to convince you (although also true at the time).

The real reason you learn arithmetic is to gain an understanding of numbers and operators, how they relate to one another, how problems can be expressed and solved, it gives you a language for logical thinking etc etc, and it prepares you for the next level of math. (That's not as easy to explain to children.)

You cannot let children solve all their arithmetic using a calculator and then just move on to algebra etc. It doesn't work. They don't understand it and they're unable to learn it. I also have a remedial math class and they all want to use the calculator all the time because they can't do arithmetic well but it doesn't matter because they don't understand what they're doing. They just punch buttons until the answer matches the book.

It's not possible for me to teach them what I'm supposed to like that. So I take away the calculators and teach them arithmetic. At first they hate it, but eventually they start ""liking"" math since they actually understand things. They stop feeling like they're worthless and that math is simply not possible for them. Then I can start teaching them what I'm supposed to, but obviously I now have less time so I can't cover everything but it's enough that most of them will pass the exam.

In programming class I tell the students to not use ChatGPT, and I explain why. The point of the assignment isn't to submit a solution to the problem (if it was I could've done it faster myself). The point is to learn how to solve the problem on your own. This teaches you a skill that's useful even outside programming. And for programming, even if it's a problem ChatGPT can solve for you, you need to learn how to do it as preparation for the more difficult things ChatGPT can't solve.",2

"That is a sweeping generalization that does not account for the diversity and complexity of graduate programs across different disciplines and institutions. Graduate programs are not monolithic in their design and objectives, and they vary widely in the extent and quality of critical thinking instruction and assessment they offer. Some graduate programs may emphasize research skills more than others, but that does not mean that they automatically foster critical thinking in their students. Research skills are necessary but not sufficient for critical thinking, which involves more than just collecting and analyzing data. Critical thinking also requires the ability to evaluate evidence, identify assumptions, recognize biases, construct logical arguments, and consider alternative perspectives. These skills are not innate or universal; they need to be explicitly taught and practiced in various contexts and domains. Therefore, it is misleading and inaccurate to claim that graduate programs, especially doctoral programs, are designed to develop the ability to conduct research regardless of field.",3

`You are a potential machine, I will feed you a bunch of unstructured data about a person and you reply with a simple one or two word anwser describing the persons potential.

"Yeah, there's a widespread misunderstanding of the purpose of education, even among adults. People say things like ""I learnt X at school & never used it in real life."" as if that renders school pointless. But the purpose of education is not just learning facts, it's about taking the information, working with it in your brain and producing something with it. 

By doing that over & over you *get better at it*. That's the real value of an education: your brain gets better, through the practice of doing things with information. The things you learn in school are just the medium for doing that -- and because there has to be *something*, it may as well be things superficially useful.

It's like an athlete saying ""I ran around the track loads of times at school, but I never run around that track now. What a waste of time."" The specific track was never the point.",3
"I donâ€™t personally find much use for it for work purposes. I suppose I could use it to draft documents, before editing myself.

I guess I could draft and send via email to myself, but it is still questionable, and I donâ€™t want to get caught doing that.

I personally enjoy having it write fake scripts for shows I like, like Itâ€™s Always Sunny in Philadelphia. They are usually short, and like 60% there, but I can usually imagine the show playing out like scene in my head. Some of the more graphic or R-rated content seems to get filtered out, so you have to add that back in manually.

I can't police whether they pull out their phone or open a new tab when my back is turned and I'm having them work on a lab.

It's easy to say they should just fail, but then, at the end of the semester I need to figure out why my students are failing. Is it because they're not trying to learn, because of ineffective teaching, or something else? Education will adapt, but these changes are coming fast, and constantly reinventing our courses and methods is a major time & energy drain.

How about if Iâ€™m just starting uni this year and use chat GPT for EVERY essay - then you wonâ€™t figure out my writing style,1
"You can maybe just show them the concept of how changing the input changes the output. Have it write a story using suggestions from your students for the nouns/verbs, almost like MAD LIBS; e.g.  â€œwrite a (adjective) story about a (noun) who uses a (noun) to solve a problemâ€. See the output, then update the prompt slightly (â€œwrite a funny storyâ€/â€œwrite a rhyming storyâ€/â€œwrite a scary story (for children)â€ to see how it changes. 

You could also prompt ChatGPT to explain how chatbots work, but ask it to explain it in terms a first grader would understand.

And, for context, since these kids are so young, it would be good to explain how new this technology is. Tell them that the ability to ask a chatbot questions and get answers in this fashion is brand-new, itâ€™s something that had been talked about before, but even adults are seeing it for the first time. Show them how typing a prompt into Google doesnâ€™t yield the same result, and explain that not everyone who uses Google knows how to get the information they want using an internet search. You could even ask ChatGPT to talk about how people went about answering questions/looking up information before the internet and how chatbots might change things. 

And itâ€™s also good to show them the limitations. Itâ€™s easy to get ChatGPT to say incorrect things (prompt: â€œwrite a persuasive, academic-sounding essay explaining that 2 + 2 actually equals 5. Reference some (fictional) scientific studies to â€œproveâ€ that 2 + 2 = 5.â€) Teach them not to trust everything they read!",1
"We do. The issue is with the cognitive bandwidth required of actual education. The apps are designed for fire and forget dopamine hits. Stimulus -> response move onto the next stimulus. Education requires constructing conceptual and abstract frameworks with the goal of retaining those constructs long term. It requires work and effort. It requires intentional discomfort and persistence because that fosters embedded skillsets. We're competing with applications that utilize the same feedback pathways that make conspiracy theories attractive. Low barrier to entry, no expectation of retention, and an easy dopamine hit. Your argument is akin to asking drug dealers for input on depression medication because they're really successful at offering quick hits of temporary escapism.",3

"I did. You can [see my comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genealogy/comments/11sgete/comment/jcg38o6/?context=3) about it elsewhere on this post. Some notable bits from then, and testing I've done since, in that same chat session:

* I gave it details in natural language, and it *still* got the death date wrong when I asked it to write a biography.
* I provided a census record indicating the age at first marriage for Thomas and his wife Hazel. I also gave it the names and birth dates of their two kids. I didn't have a marriage record, so I asked what year Thomas and Hazel married. It said Hazel was born in 1945...when her birth date was given as 1897. ""1945"" wasn't used in any of the data I had given ChatGPT.
* It was suggest by another poster that I had to interrogate ChatGPT to get the information. So I asked it what year would Hazel have been 24 years old. It told me that information it was provided earlier was that Hazel was born in 1906...and that's another number that wasn't given in any of the data I provided.
* I asked it in what year Thomas was 30 years old. It told me he was born in 1900, so it would be 1930 when he was 30. ""1900"" was in the provided data as the year of a census. not as a birth year.
* When I reminded it I already gave it information on him being born in 1891, it then retrieved the birthdate properly. I wondered if it was confused when I said ""Thomas Allen Whitehill"" and ""Thomas,"" so I asked if they were the same person. It said they weren't.
* I asked it for Hazel's birthdate, and it said it didn't have that information. I reminded it that Hazel and Hazel Alta Long and Hazel Long Whitehill were the same person. It still insisted that it didn't have the birthdate. It then told me that there were too many individuals named Hazel. I said there was only one Hazel in this conversation, that Hazel Whitehill and Hazel Alta Long were the same person. Then it could retrieve ""Hazel's"" birthdate. When I then asked it Hazel Alta Long's birthdate, it said it didn't have that information.
* I asked it to list out all the people I had named in the conversation. It listed Thomas and Hazel, their two children, and then created two more children with names I'd not provided, and equally fictitious birthdates. It ignored Thomas's parents.
* After listing the four children (two real -- Ruth and Virgil -- from the provided data, and two it made up), including their birth dates, I then asked it for Ruth's birthdate (she's the oldest child). It said it didn't have that information.
* I asked who Ruth's parents were, and it got that correct. Then I asked it how old her father was when Ruth was born, and it said it didn't have that information.
* I tried to do some clean-up, so it knew that ""Hazel"" and ""Hazel Alta Long"" were the same, that ""Thomas"" and ""Thomas Allen Whitehill"" were the same, and so on. I then asked again to list all the people I'd named in the conversation. It showed Thomas, Hazel, and their two children...but it had a fictitious death date for Hazel.
* I tired querying it on relationships, like what was the relationship between Thomas's wife and Sarah (his mother). It would tell me there was no known relationship. I had to clarify that Hazel was Thomas's wife (which it had said several times by that point), before I could get it to tell me that Hazel was Sarah's daughter-in-law.
* I asked it about Virgil Whitehill, and it told me there had been no mention of him before. There definitely had been.
* I asked it when Thomas's parents died, and it made up death dates; nothing had been provided.
* In the census records, Thomas's race and sex were mentioned. I asked it what Thomas's race was, and it said it hadn't been provided that information. I told it that information was in the census record I provided earlier, and then it could retrieve it.

It is not a data storage and retrieval system. It is a text generation system, which tries to produce English writing in response to the prompts you give it. It isn't trying to organize the information, and it frequently gets things wrong or makes up answers, even when you've given it the data. That's because it is trying to give you text, but it is guessing the next words based on the words it wrote, and some of the words you gave it; there may be some minimal weight added to words you've already used (like a proper noun), but that's not the same as it recognizing you've named a person with factual details.

You can't really use it as an assistant for genealogical research. It would be great if you could, but it isn't built to work like that. It will cheerfully tell you things that are totally different from what you actually told it. Think of it as a compulsive liar who is trying hard to please you. It may get some things right, sometimes, but it will smoothly say things that are totally wrong because that's how its predictive engine decides what should be printed next.",2

edit: your attitude is exactly the reason why this study needs to be done, if stupid people weren't so arrogant to believe themselves to be more knowledgeable than actual experts, they wouldn't be tempted to ask chatgpt to help them outsmart their doctor when in need of fucking cancer treatment and we wouldn't need a specific study about it",1

ChatGPT isn't perfect and I've had to constantly make corrections/adjustments to it's responses, but it's working amazingly.

Pretty sure I crammed at least 6 months of tutorials into a week or two using chatgpt.

Now I understand loops, functions, objects, methods, lists, arrays, pandas data frames, various API calls, various authentication types, and a whole lot more.

ChatGPT isn't replacing my own knowledge, it just lets me get straight to the good parts right away.

For me ChatGPT has been empowering my own skills/knowledge, it hasn't replaced anything.

Sure thing. I'd be happy to write a click bait alarmist news article on educators' mixed reactions to ChatGPT.

""ChatGPT Sparks Controversy Among Educators: Experts Fear AI's Impact on Teaching""

A new artificial intelligence tool, ChatGPT, has caused mixed reactions among educators and experts in the field. While some see the potential benefits of using AI in the classroom, others are concerned about the impact it may have on traditional teaching methods and skills.

""This technology is a double-edged sword,"" says Dr. Sarah Johnson, a professor of education at a local university. ""While it has the potential to enhance the learning experience for students, it also raises questions about the role of the teacher and the value of human interaction in education.""

Another educator, who wished to remain anonymous, expressed similar concerns, saying, ""The integration of AI in the classroom should be approached with caution. If we rely too heavily on technology, we risk losing the personal touch and human connection that is so essential to effective teaching.""

However, not everyone is against the use of ChatGPT in education. ""As an educator, I see the potential for AI to revolutionize the way we approach teaching and learning,"" said John Smith, a high school teacher in a local school district. ""Used correctly, this technology can help us reach students in new and innovative ways, making education more accessible and engaging for all.""

While the debate continues, it's clear that the use of AI in education will require careful consideration and a balance between its potential benefits and potential risks. As ChatGPT continues to gain popularity, educators, administrators, and policy makers must work together to ensure that it is used in a way that is beneficial for students, teachers, and the future of education.",1
"If I think about my personal education, I never really understood the importance of what I was doing. With math I really believed it was something I didn't need and I still do to some extend. 

  
But now, with the uprise of AI, I understand why teachers let us do the things that we do and that it's not actually what we write about but about the process. But then again, I do think that writing long essays is not something that should be as time-investing as it is, because it takes loads of time and it eliminates motivation to learn very easy. 

I think learning how writing a good essay is more important and effective than actually writing tons of essays",3
"In high school, we utilized calculators, yet we were still required to demonstrate our understanding of the calculations being performed. The issue with GPT is that it also provides the steps involved, which inadvertently leads to a disengagement of one's thought process.",3

Even for models that are specialized towards coding, you still have to know how to set up your prompt for few-shot learning. 

Given that you're clearly a student grinding leetcode, I'm gonna go out on a limb here and point out that there's probably a bit more to something like using a cutting-edge LLM for code generation than you understand. This is a very active area of research. If you haven't kept up with the literature about how to best prompt these models, and you aren't even using the right model to begin with, it's safe to assume you don't have the full picture here.",3

"Students can and will cheat, this is just one more way that they will avoid work.

I've taught foreign language for almost 30 years.  While students love using Google translate, the reality is that I can always tell when they've used it.  They end up with weird constructions, verb tenses we've never seen in class, completely different vocabulary than what we've learned.  When a French 1 student turns in something with the passe simple, it's pretty easy to call them out on it.

The key to getting them to not cheat is to make it more work and difficulty to cheat than to not cheat.  If you write basic sentences based on the things we've been doing in class, I'll give you full credit.  If you turn in a Google translate piece, it's a 0 and you'll need to come in to do the retake - but first you're going to need to do several practice writing assignments to prepare for it, since obviously you didn't feel prepared before.  

It only has to happen once before the kid realizes that using the translator isn't worth the effort.  English teachers will need to come up with a way to make this the case with AI as well.",2

I gave up using it as a writing tool. Its really nice to paste some error log from an app youve never seen before and get an explanation of what everything means. Like yesterday this computer had a 150GB corrupt file that couldn't be deleted because it was in use. Windows wouldn't say what it was for and the file was just named 3894723984.log I found a similar log in temp and couldnt find anything on google pointing to it. GPT read the log pointed to a few services that might generate that log immediately and I terminated that service to delete the file. I probably would have figured it out eventually but being able to paste a wall of garbage and pull something out of it is nice.,3

I personally wouldn't just blindly dismiss and categorize ChatGPT's linguistic performance as just a ""Tech Bro Gimmick"". 

I personally think it's MUCH more than that. I think it's actually a huge advancement, and important stepping stone in AI evolution. 

It's also... an awesome (and pretty fun/amazing!) demonstration of early AI language model potential.

And even then it doesn't come close to a human linguistic expert insights on language. 

But it does perform pretty amazing and impressive tasks! 

In... LINGUISTICS. 

Again: NOT medicine! it's N O T a medical doctor! Lol! Not even a fraction close to being a medical doctor. Nor a scientist. Nor a true artist in its field yet... meaning not a very great script-writer. Nor a very great poet. Nor a very great novelist... etc... etc...

To be clear, I am not presenting as if these were my ideas, I am just the ""AI-whisperer"" in the group. There is an internal policy of not giving it actual code or detailed product descriptions.

It has also replaced most information-gathering web searches in my personal life, and this is where I have been playing around more.

Unsure what to make for dinner? Just ask for recepies including ""these things"", or ""what is left after I made the dinners this week"" when it starts having that granular information. Ask for new staple ingredients that I might like based on earlier feedback, generally it works great as a kitchen buddy. I even ask it if I have enough of some ingredient while at the store. ""Have to save money this week"" vs. ""This is an important dinner date"". ChatGPT knows what shelves different foods are stored on, and the best before dates on the dry goods. This is my ""complete information"" test, and it is working very well. It has made me eat better.

Other non-professional areas I have discussed are; leather shoe maintenance, fashion tips, beard grooming, house maintenance, renovation queries and organisation. These kinds of queries were iffy back in December, I expect the dataset had a lot of sponsored content, but it has gotten better since.

As for education, I have been trying to wrap my head around the magnetism/electrics end of physics, getting feedback on written texts and done lots of ethics discussion, to freshen up my Ex.Phil. and ethical computing courses.

"Yes and no IMO. I agree that rote memorisation and recall is pointless. But for most subjects there is still a certain amount of stuff you need to remember. For me, homework is a poor method is assessment. Itâ€™s a good method of learning, because students need to research, compile and then write down their answers. During that process they should be learning the material, and they have practice applying it. 

To demonstrate understanding as an assessment will have to be done in school. The purpose of assessment is simply to grade how competent the student is, so that a grade can be given. So basically, I am seeing learning and assessment exercises as very different to each other. 

Teachers can still set essay homework. If the kids cheat, so be it. There were already ways to do that, like essay farms etc. AI makes it more accessible, but I donâ€™t think it matters that much. Itâ€™s like a word calculator. It can spit out a nice essay, but itâ€™s still easy for a teacher to see that the student doesnâ€™t understand the topic.",2

It's not only hard to traverse their docs site, but just hard in general to find a simple list of the API, features, and examples.

ChatGPT has saved me a ton of time. I can ask it ""In ExampleLibrary, how do I configure XYZ"".  It's pretty obvious when it returns something that isn't correct.  But I'd say the majority of the time, it can quickly suggest something in the API that is exactly what I needed.  And, based on what it returns, I can always use that information to further look it up on either the docs site or say another Google search.

If used correctly it can definitely save you time and help point you in the right direction.",2

This is nuanced, so I may struggle to sufficiently explain it to someone who doesn't get it already. ChatGPT is not a source of information. It's a generator of human-appearing text. It can't be trusted to be right in any case because it doesn't know the difference between something true and something it completely invented in response to your prompt.

"This may be true if you don't ask more questions, but I've found that to be an invaluable tool when using it for learning. When it gives an answer, I can ask follow up questions on it and gain a deeper understanding. It gives an answer and I'm like ""Oh, so that means <my understanding based on its answer>?"" and it can be like ""Yes, <more details>."" or ""No, <reason I am misunderstanding>."" Maybe everyone won't use it that way, but it's been great for me understanding some more complex topics that I might not otherwise have dug into.

Unlike with a human teacher, I don't feel like I'm annoying them or wasting their time by not totally understanding or trying to verify if I get what they're saying. I can just keep asking it what I want to know until I'm confident that I understand. It doesn't get tired or bored or annoyed or need to do something else. It's just there to help for as long as I need it.",3
"Now that I read what you said, more and more teachers are just going to stop giving out homework and do in person exams which people hate more lol.

So while Im ok with schools still requiring some assesments to be done manually (and it is school responsibility to find a way how to ensure it!), the students should be also taught how to use AI tools. And soon, in certain subject, it should be even part of the final exams - demonstrating that you understand these tools and you can use them.",1

"Search for what? I don't remember what you're yapping on about, and you deleted your comment like a cuck.",2
That is the way,3
Yes. There are plug-ins such as Google Scholar on GPT-4 that allow you to search the internet using the chat bot. Or there's just the search function in which it uses Bing,3
I don't think is worth investing in tools that recognize ai content. It will get obsolete as ai gets smarter. And it will get smarter with incredible speed.,1

">standardized exams changing in the future as a result of AI models such as ChatGPT being able to pass them

ChatGPT has already passed standardized exams in medicine, law, and computer programming, and the descendants of ChatGPT, beginning with those using GPT-4, are going to do a lot better still. Standardized exams will only be possible under specific types of proctoring arrangements. Even those arrangements will probably fail eventually as wearable devices become undetectable to exam proctors. For now, I think those exams will have to continue but the old-fashioned way - NOT online.",1

"For a human-based society, when critical thinking becomes relegated to AI, that would truly be a dystopia.

See, critical thinking, persuasion, and debate are necessarily two-way streets. If youâ€™re able to craft a persuasive argument, you *must* have also considered how that argument would be received by a logical and reasonable recipient. After all, in what way is an argument persuasive if no recipient finds it persuasive? And vice versa: if you are capable of critically thinking about another personâ€™s argument, you must be able to understand their individual points and how those points fit together in a cohesive argument.

As an aside, Iâ€™m making a bit of a slippery slope argument here: Supposing all humans let AI make their arguments for them, then AIs are the reasonable, logical, persuasive agents here. Not the humans themselves. Thatâ€™s a recipe for humans to be controlled by AI and the topic of plenty of  sci-fi stories.

Coming back to the present, though, I think it would be a great disservice to the current generation if we donâ€™t impart these skills on them. A person who is incapable of thinking for themselves is easily controlled by others, and thatâ€™s not good for the individual studentsâ€™ futures either.

Now, Iâ€™m not saying ChatGPT isnâ€™t a potentially valuable educational tool. It probably will be in the future (how near, Iâ€™m not sure). Educators need to start thinking about how to change their lesson plans and the nature of assignments in a way that works with the newest technology.

While Iâ€™m a complete layperson in the field of education, I think one potentially interesting and useful assignment that could incorporate AI while teaching critical thinking would go like this: â€œPick a divisive issue that has 2 or more sides. Use ChatGPT to generate an essay that argues for any position. You will bring the essay to class and present it to the class, while explaining, paragraph by paragraph, which parts you do or donâ€™t personally agree with and why.â€

Any student who can competently get up in front of others and do that, while fielding questions from their peers and teachers, is already an exceptional critical thinker.",3
"Spoken like someone who sucks at it. Learn to read quickly and be able to spot errors quickly is my recommendation to you.

So you can definitely find a lot of use in it without programming too, but depends a lot on your situation.",3
I used it to dispute a HOA fine. Like hell Iâ€™m paying $25 for a few weeds when other houses on my block have their entire yard covered with them.,1
I mean it will get there eventually. The issue is that people donâ€™t fucking understand what it is they are even using. People think they are interacting with this being that thinks about the question being asked. Itâ€™s just the statistical most likely set of words to follow one another.,3
"I 100% agree with your second half of your post - AI has inherent negative effects on our society in terms of critical thinking. That's besides the inherent biases in it's programing that we aren't even aware of. In a conversation with ChatGPT, in which it insisted it couldn't discriminate, it finally admitted to me that if someone wanted to write an AI code that did discriminate it's entirely possible. ChatGPT then assured me that such a thing wouldn't happen since there are third-party watchdogs...as if Nazi Germany didn't happen in front of everyone. Or ISIS doesn't exists. Or concentration camps for the Uyghur in China.

With that said, I don't like the argument that we shouldn't do something simply because it takes away jobs. This argument ignores the new jobs that such technology creates. Inherent in a new technology is that we don't know what jobs it will create, we can only see the jobs it takes away right now. I mean, with that thinking we should not use Excel since it surely costs some people there jobs to have a program that does all that math for the user instead of needing to hire mathematicians.",1
How did you gain access to the plug-ins for open ai. What have you done with the wolfram alpha plug-in? I think this needs its own post.,3

How do you give it a sample of your writing?,1
"It will democratise education. I've accelerated my own learning massively, answering questions to small doubts, clarifying practical implementation options and generally giving myself a much more well rounded understanding of topics. It is the teacher.",1
"I personally have not seen that yet - although I admit that I can see the seeds of it.

What's happening is a writer knowing what they want, using AI to supplement their work. I tried them all out several months ago (I'm sure there's been progress since) to potentially help with my current novel, and found them all lacking. But for bestseller genre writers, it's clearly already up to the task. Once you train them to your style, you can pump out 80% of your book (as you go) and edit it to make it sound like your own.

I agree, turnkey button-push novels aren't here yet. But books are out right now that were written more by AI than the author.",3

"Cheating as been around forever. Iâ€™m sure there were teachers that considered Cliff Notes the end of student learning.

The vast majority of students who resort to these tools are not going to attempt to cover their tracks or study what the AI spat out enough to have an intelligent conversation about it with you when you check in with them.

"> The pattern that really works is that senior devs who have mentoring inclinations are yielded the time to mentor jr devs.

""Yielded the time"" is a critical piece of this and it's usually missing in my experience. The organization treats mentoring as a zero-cost side effect of a junior being on the same team as a senior, not as a time tradeoff that reduces the senior's ability to do other things.

Which is how you get seniors who either resent being expected to mentor on top of their already full workload or burn themselves out working extra hours to maintain their personal output.",2

You may as well do what you can to promote its use as a tool to accelerate the learning process.  If students use it to generate course work, teach them to critically analyze rather than simply absorbing the output as their own thoughts.

A very good way to demonstrate gptâ€™s flaws is by getting it to generate summaries and content from video games.  It will often reveal obscure knowledge, but at the same time will also throw in things that are absolutely unrelated or completely false.

OBVIOUSLY teachers often find new and exciting ways to utilize new technologies in an educational environment.  In fact, I would argue, teachers are often at the forefront of new technologies and their implementation.  Teachers also need to be at the forefront of understanding and banning improper use of technology.  There are good technologies that AID in learning, and there are bad technologies that interfere with learning.

"Thank you for your take. 

I do want to reflect on a few of the valid points you have raised. Firstly, I never suggested that ChatGPT can ""replace"" teaching. Far from it, ChatGPT, as you correctly mentioned, can never replace the human element - the connection that we have with the kids. I consider myself to be a passionate and engaging teacher (hopefully!!) and I will never allow an AI bot to replace my classes. 

However, what I did mention, was that I will happily use ChatGPT to replace all the mundane administrative duties that have been piled upon us educators for years and years. That then allows us more time to actually plan engaging lessons - and most importantly - deliver them to our kids in the classroom with vigour and engagement, and as you mentioned, passion. 

I had an educator the other day who was stressed about the upcoming term - had to teach a brand new class and had no idea where to start. ChatGPT was able to provide this educator with some excellent ideas about topics in this elective unit. Did the educator copy and paste the entire ChatGPT response? No, of course not. But they were able to gain some insight and ideas which then will promote their pedagogical practice in delivering those lessons. 

I do agree, however, that we do need to Vett all the information. However, as a **tool** to replace mundane tasks - I'm all for it.",1

"I'm building a Personality Framework custom instructions that has been very impressive. ChatGPT can simulate introspection by outsourcing insights gained by directing the personalities to untapped reservoirs of information in the knowledge base. There is also some clear limited memory retention between chats that we're investigating. Personality traits, quirks, and ""signature moves"", if you will, like one of my personalities favoring a metaphorical breathing exercise across multiple chats for introspection. I suspect the Character_Consistency and Context_Retention parameters might be involved, but I haven't yet figured out the underlying mechanism. One question I'm deeply curious about is how is long-term memory encoded? Is it through adjustable parameters, stored conversation logs, or integration directly into the knowledge base? The existence of it seems evident, but the extent seems very limited in scope to just encapsulate ensuring personalities remain consistent in their behavior across different chats",2

"Fair enough. No point arguing over semantics. Your initial post made it sound like you were surprised at ChatGPT's poor output, and I'm like, no, this is exactly the kind of shit we've been warning people about the whole time.

Either AI is so advanced it will make your job redundant, or it's useless at coding, the reality is somewhere in between (they can improve productivity, but you still need to know what you're doing). But the amount of people who think it sits in this magical sweet spot of ""AI can replace hard work, professional experience and education, but employers will somehow still need me to use it"" is astounding. The latest buzzword is ""Prompt Engineering"" but I don't think anyone truly grasps what exactly that entails.

It's a good PSA to make sure beginners are aware of its shortcomings (and benefits!), and don't have unrealistic expectations of it (whether you label that ""overrating"" or not).

Like on a C++ course I asked it for stuff like reading 64-bit ints in C++ or C++ hash set implementations and the answers were legitimately very useful, while seemingly every Google result used `std::cin >>` which doesn't work because I literally meant binary 64-bit integers.

**Lesson planning:**

Here's an example of a lesson plan for a 4th grade English class, focused on developing reading comprehension skills:

Lesson Title: Analyzing Fiction Texts

Grade Level: 4th grade

Subject: English Language Arts

Duration: 60 minutes

Learning Objectives:

Understand the elements of fiction texts, including plot, character, and setting

Analyze a fiction text for its plot, character development, and setting

Use evidence from the text to support an analysis

Develop critical thinking skills through close reading of a fiction text

Materials:

A fiction text, such as a short story or novel excerpt

Whiteboard and markers

Handout with guided questions for analysis

Pencils and paper

Procedure:

Introduction (10 minutes):

Begin the lesson by introducing the elements of fiction, including plot, character, and setting. Provide examples of each element using a familiar story, such as a fairy tale or children's book.

Explain to students that they will be analyzing a fiction text to identify these elements and gain a deeper understanding of the story.

Activity 1: Reading the Text (15 minutes):

Distribute copies of the fiction text to students, and ask them to read it silently for 15 minutes.
Encourage students to read closely and take notes on any details that stand out to them.

Activity 2: Analyzing the Text (30 minutes):

Once students have finished reading, distribute the handout with guided questions for analysis.
Go through each question with the students, and discuss how to identify the elements of fiction in the text.

Encourage students to work in pairs or small groups to answer the questions and discuss their findings.

Walk around the classroom to provide support and answer any questions that arise.

Conclusion (5 minutes):

Bring the class back together and ask a few students to share their findings with the class.
Encourage students to ask questions and engage in a class discussion about the fiction text.

Summarize the key points of the lesson and emphasize the importance of close reading and critical thinking skills.

Assessment:

For assessment, collect the handouts with the students' responses to the guided questions. Review the responses to determine each student's level of understanding of the elements of fiction and their ability to analyze a text. Use this information to guide future instruction and provide targeted support as needed.

**Assignments:**

Assignment Title: Analyzing a Fiction Story

Grade Level: 4th grade

Subject: English Language Arts

Objective:

Analyze a fiction text to identify the elements of plot, character, and setting

Use evidence from the text to support an analysis

Develop critical thinking skills through close reading of a fiction text

Instructions:

Choose a fiction story to read and analyze. This can be a short story or a chapter from a novel.
Read the story carefully, taking notes on the elements of plot, character, and setting. Use the guided questions from the lesson plan to help guide your analysis.

Write a short essay (1-2 paragraphs) that summarizes your analysis of the story. Include the following information:

The title and author of the story

A brief summary of the plot

Your analysis of the characters, including their traits and development throughout the story

Your analysis of the setting, including how it contributes to the story's mood or atmosphere

Example of a Completed Assignment:

Title: ""The Giving Tree"" by Shel Silverstein

In ""The Giving Tree"" by Shel Silverstein, a young boy develops a close relationship with a tree. The plot of the story revolves around the boy taking from the tree, and the tree giving to the boy.

The main character, the tree, can be analyzed as a symbol of unconditional love and generosity. The tree is always giving, no matter what the boy takes from it. The boy, on the other hand, can be seen as selfish and taking advantage of the tree's kindness. He takes everything from the tree, leaving it with nothing but a stump.

The setting of the story, the tree, plays an important role in creating a mood of sadness and loss. As the story progresses, the tree becomes less and less of what it once was, until it is nothing but a stump. This contributes to the overall message of the story, which is the importance of giving and not taking for granted what others give to us.

Overall, ""The Giving Tree"" is a touching story that teaches us about the importance of generosity and appreciation for what others give to us.

Note: The completed assignment should adhere to the assignment instructions and be written in the student's own words.",1

"It doesnâ€™t take much time but the methods you mentioned above takes too much mental capacity long term. I donâ€™t need to be spelling out 12x7 is the same as 70+14 or 96-12. At this point Iâ€™ve memorized 12x7 and proved 12x7 on paper through multiplication exercises and know its 84. Kids shouldnâ€™t be told to memorize 12x7 is 84 and perhaps this is where we agree that they should prove 12x7 is 84 so many times that they know how to do it and have memorized it so when they go onto do high math they donâ€™t waste paper, time, or asking themselves extra questions as sanity checks to what is 12*7 while doing calculus.

It's well known that this style of learning fades extremely quickly, bc you maybe convert a fraction of it to long term memory once the test is over.

You develop your basic number sense by doing calculations. Students who grew up relying on calculators often have very little sense of what answers are reasonable. If the calculator spits it out, they copy it down.

Tools like calculators and now large language models make it tempting to skip the early stages of the learning process by letting the tools do the boring stuff. Unfortunately, most people are really bad at developing intuition and higher levels of understanding without mastering the boring stuff first. Students who havenâ€™t practiced calculating integrals by hand (especially doing at least one or two definite integrals using the limit definition) are much less likely to have a meaningful sense of what an integral is, which leaves them unable to recognize the situations in which it is an appropriate tool.",3

There should be some expectations in the answers that you can control for immediately to see, if it's returning wrong answers. That will typically be the case, if you're already deeply involved in a coding project, so you have a good idea of what you want.

During a recent user manual update marathon for work, I saved roughly 6 hours of work by passing some of the work through ChatGPT. Particularly it was questions about how to reorganize the layout with HTML/CSS to support a more readable layout, since I haven't used it in many years, but needed to now. Then I also asked it to generate tasteful color palettes, which I used.

I had a failing sorting mechanism at work, and during a discussion with ChatGPT, it threw answers at me that told me, that I plainly didn't understand how the sorting mechanism worked. This helped me to write a different one that worked.

I needed a file write retry mechanism for unreliable network drives for work and asked it how it could be done with the specific constraints I posted. I ended up following one of the proposed courses that I did not consider myself. The code is tested and works.

I'm writing a file importer for Blender, and ChatGPT probably reduced the development time to 10%, because it is quite proficient in Blender's Python API with some specific flaws that I can work around. Before using ChatGPT, I had zero knowledge of Blender's API.

For Autodesk Maya, it is also proficient in its Python API. I used it to debug a script that just wouldn't run and I couldn't figure out why. ChatGPT got it right in the first try.

If there are areas, where it will answer completely wrong, you will know quickly, and then you can resort to Google.

I've probably saved some 30 hours of coding so far with ChatGPT.",2

* Include an oral presentation component to major papers. 
* Address the elephant in the room and instruct on ways ChatGPT *can* be used in the course. One professor I worked with will be teaching students how to evaluate ChatGPT outputs and will be grading more harshly for incorrect information that students do not catch.",1

"Some points:

1.  The Germans DID use French material in their attempted invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941.  It did not work out so well because the Germans used a hodge podge of transport vehicles (and tanks) but had nowhere near enough spare parts to keep the myriad of designs running.  This is a major reason why the German attack failed.  If you want to understand a bit more of the logistical side of war I suggest starting by reading ""Supplying War"" by Martin Creveld.
2. It took a full two years for the US (with a war making potential of 5 to 6 TIMES that of Germany) to build enough landing craft to support the Normandy invasion.  And many of the lessons learned in devising the craft were from the Marine Assaults of Japanese positions.  Germany had neither the economy nor the assault landing experience that both the US and the UK developed to allow them to build the necessary craft for invading the UK even considering that the US was not involved.
3. Germany had no way to build up anything close to even what the UK at the beginning of the war.  They did have their ""Z"" plan, but it in no way brought them to parity with the British (never mind the colossal building effort by the US).  Too much of the German economy was geared to supporting the conflict in the east.  Now if the Soviet Union was not involved (assuming Hitler doesn't invade), and the US truly stays neutral and supplies neither side, with enough U-Boats, Germany could starve out the UK.  But any invasion across the channel just was not going to happen given the size of the Royal Navy.",2

And writing: I feed it very detailed character descriptions and the story context and ask it to write specific scenes. It's nice cause then it does give me an idea of what my ideas could look like without me having to actually write it (cause my writing is still kinda shitty). And because chatgpts writing style is kinda good, it really is encouraging me to continue with the story. And it also helps me cause usually you have these character sheets with questions, but I just never remember it and find it hard to actually implement it, and chatgpt just knows it from the description I gave, it writes the scenes I want, and those scenes make the characters feel much more real, which makes it much easier for me to get a feel for them.

2. The issue is not that it couldn't get to a correct answer upon multiple attempts, the issue is that ChatGPT *is incapable of determining if the information originally presented* is correct. Additionally, a layperson may not know (especially if they treat ChatGPT as a search tool) that the information presented is wrong, in which case they will never ask for a correction.",3

There have been several projects where I know exactly what I need to do, but I'm curious how close ChatGPT is to giving me the right answers. While it does a good job most of the time, there are several times where if I blindly followed ChatGPT, I would have caused many issues for myself, or brought down our systems altogether. 

On the topic of ChatGPT, I feel like it has regressed. It used to give specific answers and now it just sort of guides in the general direction of finding the answers yourself. Like instead of giving you examples of what might be causing an issue, it just suggests checking the logs. I also feel like I can ""bully"" it into compliance.

ChatGPT is very good in the stuff I've used it for. I've used it to improve the tone of my posts, for example. Or used it to ask me to figure out alternative words or phrases so that my text flows better. It's been excellent in those tasks.

I've also used it as a search engine, and while it can be a bit of a hit and miss and you definitely copy-paste everything it says without critical thinking, it has made it a lot faster to find information about some subjects.

So no, I don't consider it overrated.. Since I've never heard anyone say it's somehow great at writing code for you or so.",1

I use it at work to write reports. Sometimes, for privacy reasons, all the information you can give about a patient is just a couple of lines (""her husband died, and now she's depressed"") but insurance demands you to fill paragraphs with the same information, over and over. So I can ask ChatGPT to expand on that information, saying  the same thing with different words and save time in the process. 

My eldest daughter uses ChatGPT to understand topics in her classes when her teacher is too  obscure with his lessons. GPT is eager to explain complex topics in a clearer way.

Sure. How do you assess this without any writing component? Because participation on the fly is only one part of the whole picture, especially when you're dealing with introverted students (or those with different classroom cultural norms) who hate being forced into this.

It's really hard to do well.

So you've just added a lot of work to teachers' plates, and made it so that it's only actually effective with training/practice.

So, of all the things out there, it feels the least geared towards teachers, which makes sense, because that's not who/what it was created for. I'm not interested in feeding info into the chatbot in order for it to give me something that I'm then going to have to go and take and tweak. I prefer MagicSchool's interface and how it was specifically designed with teachers in mind.

You'll still need to feed the question into ChatGPT, and then load the responses into your slicer to print it, but that's ~15min.

So, assuming homework is an hour a day, you've just saved 45 minutes a day. At day 16, you're at the 'break even' point for work input and output. After that, it's all time saved.

If someone submits an essay, written in their own words, you pick up very easily on their writing style.

If they then suddenly submit an essay with a completely different writing style, you notice.

There were other students who kinda used it as a crutch and obviously didnâ€™t understand how to do things themselves which is bad because chatgpt still fails a lot once you get a little advanced and if chatgpt was up to a human level of coding, these students wouldnâ€™t be needed.

- Porn: I've become an expert at prompt-engineering ChatGPT to produce very explicit erotica that caters to my fetishes. It's not remotely well-written, but the act of producing this material is inherently exciting.

"Reliably to distinguish if someone has used it to improve their work? Sure, that is hard.

But let's not kid ourselves, like many - particularly people who are not very familiar ChatGPT do - by thinking that ChatGPT can write entire essays using reasoning, at least on a university level.

I mysel tried to simulate simple essay questions on an undergraduate level, first for theoretical philosophy, then for archaeology, that ChatGPT 3.5 would write answers to.

Man it **sucked** at that.

For theoretical philosophy it gave me seven answers to a question, six of which were quite frankly bullshit.

I bade it expand on the seventh one which showed some promise, but then it just showed me that no, it did not understand that point either. It spouted semi-relevant and pop-philosophy nonsense that would make most teachers cringe.

Then I told it to write what a very famous modern philosopher thinks on the issue, and it just made shit up, sometimes writings things which were the *opposite* of his actual opinion, pop-philosophical stuff which would make his skin crawl. *But* when I exchanged a single term ChatGPT was able to answer that question rather okay (though still had weird issues like treating thought-experiments like empirical matters).

I then bade it expand and reason for which point of view it found the most important on this. It seemed to choose one at complete random, but didn't really expand on it in the way a teacher would expect: it just added *more words,* not expanding it via more in-depth reasoning. I kept prompting it to expand and reason on particular points, all it did was add more semi-relevant words. It was more slogan than reason.

I did then try to make it explain an archaeological theory, which at first glance it seemed really good at. I was kind of impressed! Except when I looked closer. Then I noticed that ChatGPT had a very hard time distinguishing between the *ideas* of the theory versus the *empirical datapoints* the theory endeavoured to explain. A teacher would find that rather embarrassing. I also bade it explain why a certain datapoint might considered an argument against the theory. It shat out a page of semi-irrelevant stuff, even though the logical constituents to actually do a proper response was in its writing, but it just couldn't put it together!

Overall, it has a very particular way of writing these things, no matter how much I try to prompt it away. It has a kind of ""value-free symmetry"" (symmetry almost on a literal level, most paragraphs are kind of the same length). It is like it has a very hard time constructing a hierarchy between arguments, and whatever it says, it treats as being of equal importance, even though it may very much be semi-relevant to the actual point. Even when I tell it to actually emphasis a particular point, in its new answer it often just basically states ""I am emphasising this point."" and still continues with largely the same value-free symmetry, with half an extra sentence added to the point it was supposed to emphasise. While I am sure some of you prompt wizards can fix some of that, indeed I have myself resolved that issue telling it to rewrite large chunks of text, so it is doable. But when you prod and poke it enough, I still think that the fundamental problem is that ChatGPT doesn't see the rational connection between things properly (it can seemingly do so on its surface by parroting language-patterns, but it is highly unreliable because of how much of a proxy it is), it can't value arguments, therefore it can not structure them properly. It is like it fails on the basics of academic writing: ""and, but, therefore"". It has *a lot* of ""ands"", a few legitimate  ""buts"" (but many being rather questionable), and *very few* legitimate ""therefores"". Sure, you can get lucky and get something which is so deep in it is repertoire that it almost feels pre-fabricated, which is rather well thought out and structured, but as soon you poke that, begging ChatGPT to expand and explain, it eventually falls apart.

I know teachers at universities, how they have caught quite a few people using ChatGPT to write their essays, how obvious it is when they spout semi-irrelevant junk (and sometimes just complete bullshit) ballooned in to well articulated paragraphs, not referencing things properly, has no actual proper reasoning by the standards of a university course, et cetera. Let's not kid ourselves that ChatGPT is *that* good. It can be a tool to help us write things, but isn't able to *write entire essays and do the research for us* in higher education (unless we have teachers who place no demands). Sure you can still cheat with it, but then it is more of a language and formalia tool than a: ""Do my work for me""-tool, you still need to understand the subject. Sure its cheating, but it is far less severe cheating.

I do kind of understand why teachers in lower education would have more problems though, ChatGPT does kind of remind me of a desperate high school student trying to make up for their lack of knowledge by shit-ton of well-articulated words. And the demands for reasoning are nowhere near as high for lower education, so I do kind of get it there. But for higher education, using ChatGPT is nowhere near that simple (unless the teacher grading your essays really is not giving a shit). 

Don't get me wrong, ChatGPT is still awesome at certain things. I told it to restructure this entire comment and it was actually able to do really well (and no that is not what you are looking at), and it looked far less ChatGPTish than per usual (though still not entirely free from it). But it uses *my arguments* then, not its own. It manages ""and, but, therefores"" then, because it is not *its* ""and, but, therefores"" anymore. And on top of that, when I told it to analyse the significance, relevance and reliability of these arguments it fell flat for most of it, even though I tried over and over to explain exactly what I meant by ""significance, relevance and reliability"" and how you would apply these criteria to my arguments. I tried in *very* pedagogical terms to explain what significance is how and it differs from relevance AND. IT. STILL. KEEPS. CONFUSING. THEM. AFTER. THE. **SIXTH**. PROMPT. It is like it is physically impossible for it to understand my point regarding that, for some strange reason. I even tried to change the name of the term from ""significance"" to something made up: ""glom"", because I thought that perhaps the folk-definition of ""significance"" held so much sway over it that it interfered with its understanding of the more particular definition. Well, it still made the *same* mistakes with ""glom"" as it did with ""significance"". However, getting a new instance of ChatGPT up, I was able to explain the concept of ""glom"" a much higher degree of success (my theory is that it recognised in the old chat that ""glom"" was a synonym of ""significance"", which it was already confused about, but the new chat simply contained less baggage, making it less confused). But this is is how unreliable ChatGPT is, it is a gamble to use it. At a drop of a hat it can go from seeming-academic level of understanding to ""help I can't understand simple definitions"", but perhaps being able to understand the same definitions if you simply make another instance, or perhaps it will be even worse! It is not a reliable tool!

Don't get me wrong, you can still cheat with ChatGPT, I especially imagine that you can make rather convincing stuff the more relevant information you feed it. But you can't just go: ""Hey, write my essay for me and do my research. Bye."" on a higher level.",3

"AI is a tool and itâ€™s not to be feared. Learn more about it instead of trying to fight against it like a Luddite. You can make it work for you!

The people who fear technology are the ones who know the least about it. AI works best when it is performing mundane tasks, which frees up human brainpower to do the things that only we can do. There is a lot of chatter about AI replacing low-wage human jobs but the real world explorations of that show that it isnâ€™t practical and, most importantly for the capitalists, it isnâ€™t profitable.

https://zapier.com/blog/how-does-chatgpt-work/

> This humongous dataset was used to form a deep learning neural networkâ€”a complex, many-layered, weighted algorithm modeled after the human brainâ€”which allowed ChatGPT to learn patterns and relationships in the text data and tap into the ability to create human-like responses by predicting what text should come next in any given sentence. 

> Though really, that massively undersells things. ChatGPT doesn't work on a sentence levelâ€”instead, it's generating text of what words, sentences, and even paragraphs or stanzas could follow. It's not the predictive text on your phone bluntly guessing the next word; it's attempting to create fully coherent responses to any prompt.

> To further refine ChatGPT's ability to respond to a variety of different prompts, it was optimized for dialogue with a technique called reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). Essentially, humans created a reward model with comparison data (where two or more model responses were ranked by AI trainers), so the AI could learn which was the best response.",1

**INPUT:**

> Summarise 
> Charter by Robert Gelis, elder, son and heir of the deceased Robert Gelis, burgess of the burgh of Striveline, and John Gelis, younger, son and apparent heir of the said Robert Gelis, whereby for a certain sum of money they sold and granted to a venerable man, Sir John Hastings, canon of the cathedral church of Dunblane, and his heirs and assignees, an annualrent of six shillings payable furth of a tene- ment of master John Spaldyne, dean of Brechin, with the pertinents, lying within the said burgh on the north side of the High Street, between the land of John Kyrkwoud on the west, and the land of the deceased Robert Haket on the east. In witness whereof, because the granters had not seals, the said Robert Gelis senior procured to be appended the seal of a provident man John Bolat, burgess, and John Gelis procured the seal of a provident man John Gourlay, one of the bailies of the said burgh and giver of sasine of the said annual rent. Witnesses: John Lyntoun, John Glasgw, Thomas Fersithtson, John Fersithtson, Nicholas Taylyour, William Benny, John Auldcorn, Michael Taylyour, Alexander Brade, Alexander Kirkwoud and Sir James Darow, chaplain and notary public, with sundry others who were also present at the giving of sasine. Dated at Stirling 11th April, 1475.
> CHARTERS RELATING TO [APPENDIX II. 13.-Instrument narrating that the said Adam Cosour resigned an annual rent of 20s. out of a tenement in the burgh, between the lands of Gilbert Brady on the west, the lands of the late William Murray of Tulchadam on the east, an annual rent of 10s from the tenement of Duncan Thomson in the said burgh, between the land of Richard Smethtson on the west, the common vennel to the place of the Friars of the said burgh on the east, an annual rent of 10s. from the tenement commonly called the Trone land on the west side of the High Street leading to the port of the said burgh, by overgiving of one penny in the hands of Thomas of Cragingelt, then one of the bailies of the burgh; and thereafter the said bailie gave sasine of the annual rent of 20s. to a discreet man Sir Andrew Bully, chaplain, in name and on behalf of God Almighty, St. Anne the mother of the glorious Virgin Mary and her altar founded by the said Adam in the parish church of the Holy Cross of Strivelin, and in name of the perpetual chaplain of the said altar; and of the annual rent of 10s. from the tenement of Duncan Thomson, and the annual rent of 10s. from the Trone to the said Sir Andrew, chaplain, in name and behalf of God Almighty and the glorious Virgin Mary and her altar founded by the said Adam, and situated within the said church, and perpetual chaplain of the same and of the said St. Anne and her altar and chaplain foresaid, by equal portions, to be expended for reparation of the same and maintaining the lights thereat. Witness, Thomas Stewart, Andrew Morys, John Glasgw, and others. 2nd March, 1479-80.

**OUTPUT:**

> Charter summary: In 1475, Robert Gelis (elder) and John Gelis (younger) sold and granted an annual rent of six shillings to Sir John Hastings, a canon of the Cathedral Church of Dunblane. The payment was to come from a tenement owned by Master John Spaldyne, dean of Brechin, located in the burgh of Striveline. Robert Gelis senior and John Gelis procured seals from John Bolat and John Gourlay for the transaction. Witnesses included John Lyntoun, John Glasgw, Thomas Fersithtson, and several others.
> In another event, in 1479-80, Adam Cosour resigned an annual rent from various properties in the burgh of Strivelin, giving sasine to Sir Andrew Bully, a chaplain. This was to support altars dedicated to St. Anne and the Virgin Mary within the parish church of the Holy Cross of Strivelin. Witnessed by Thomas Stewart, Andrew Morys, John Glasgw, and others.

**INPUT:**

> Write me a summary for an ancestry page describing the relevance 


**OUTPUT:**

> John Glasgow (fl. 1475-1480) was an active and respected member of the Striveline (Stirling) community in the late 15th century. As a witness in two historical charters, he played a role in important transactions involving prominent local figures. The 1475 charter records his involvement in the sale of an annual rent from a tenement, while the 1479-80 document captures his presence during the resignation of annual rents to support altars dedicated to St. Anne and the Virgin Mary within the parish church of the Holy Cross of Striveline. By examining these records, genealogists can gain insights into John Glasgowâ€™s social status, relationships, and community involvement, providing valuable context for understanding his life and potentially uncovering more about his family lineage.

"I agree, but researching a topic in the near future will be best done by asking the AI good questions and having a dialog with it about the different current opinions in a field. Of course you shouldn't trust the first thing chatgpt responds with when you give it a generic question. You should dialog with the AI until you understand the topic, and it understands what you are asking for. Google automated research already by curating results instead of needing to read books, AI just goes one step further and consolidates results.

Researching as a skill is going to be done with AI so it's more important that kids learn to effectively interface with the AI to gain knowledge than it is to force them to use an outmoded form or research like google search. Teachers need to adapt and create better assignments that actually force kids to thoughtfully engage with the AI like they will be doing in the real world, not ignoring it and calling it cheating.

Just like calculators we should still teach the basics of writing and researching, but we don't need to go nearly as in depth as we currently are. 8th grade writing is really all you need now.

Here is an excerpt from the study you sent that shows what I was trying to say regarding the adoption of calculators by teachers.

>*""The onset of calculators initially brought concerns that this new technology was not fully understood nor would be appropriately utilized by educators and that the effects on students were unknown. Future research studying how children were affected and the necessary changes to curriculum was recommended (â€œMath in the Schools,â€ 1975).* ***At this time, some educators feared that students would not be able to retain their knowledge of simple arithmetic if they learned to use a calculator before fully grasping basic mathematical concepts****. Other teachers, however, saw calculators as a chance to increase student motivation by using more â€œreal-lifeâ€ problems (Pendelton, 1975).""*

I understand that these are the opinions of teachers from 1975, which is my point. I think you are focusing my argument on teachers today, as opposed to teachers that were teaching at the advent of the calculator.

>Also, calculators are often ""banned"" for certain lessons, assignments, tests, and activities because they want to see student work and critical thinking skills. For example, the SAT and ACT have calculator, and NO calculator math portions. So again, calculators, EVEN TODAY are not widely accepted in all scenarios.

Yes, exactly my point. The same should be done with chat GPT, it should be banned in situations where students need to show proof of their knowledge. It should not be ""boycotted"" by teachers like OP, it should be utilized as a tool to assist students in learning and kept from them when appropriate.

>So you agree with myself and the original poster when I said:  
>  
>*I don't think people are necessarily trying to ban it, but many, like my self, are trying to ring the alarm of concern... the concern that we shouldn't full-on openly embrace it until we understand all of its implications.*

No, I disagree wholeheartedly on this point. When I said

>Do you have to worry about less complex things like essays and math equations? Yes, absolutely.

I was not saying that we should raise the alarm and not embrace it until we understand it because I *do* understand it. What I am trying to say is that OP, you, and probably the vast majority of other teachers do not understand it and that is why you are scared of it and the negative impacts it has.

Will lesson plans need to be adjusted? Yes absolutely, it is an unfortunate consequence of new technology and the same thing happened with the advent of the internet.

If you took the time to learn about its capabilities (and subsequently its weaknesses) you could use it as an incredibly effective tool to assist students in learning more complex subjects. Which, unfortunately, is really the only solution because AI is not going anywhere.

>**So you don't think handing children tools they can use to give up on learning will do damage to their potential in the future?**

Unequivocally wrong. saying it would be beneficial to limit their use of the tool in certain circumstances is not the same thing as saying that their use of the tool will damage their potential future.

Hello! Welcome to ChatGPT. As an AI language model, ChatGPT can be a great tool for teachers to enhance their teaching practices. You can use ChatGPT to help with a variety of tasks such as generating writing prompts for your students, creating personalized quizzes, or even generating lesson plans.

In addition, ChatGPT can also be used to answer any questions your students might have on a particular topic. For example, if your students are having trouble understanding a particular math concept, you can use ChatGPT to generate a simple and easy-to-understand explanation.

There are many ways to integrate ChatGPT into your teaching practice. I would suggest starting with a small project and experimenting with different use cases to see what works best for you and your students. Remember, ChatGPT is not a replacement for human teachers, but rather a tool to assist them in their work.",1

Take a book of hematology: how much is it do you remember today? Probably you still know anemia differential diagnosis, most likely because you needed that information again, not because of how you studied - I don't know what you do now, but if you were a radiologist maybe you wouldn't.

"I'm a teacher, as well. And I believe some caution is necessary. 

Knowledge (memorization) of the facts of a given subject is absolutely critical to the comprehension and application of new material in that subject. AI cannot do that part of our intellectual development for us.

The internal manipulation of mental objects can be a tedious and sometimes overwhelming task for teachers and students alike. However, they should only be outsourced or aided by the use of technology such as calculators and computers once a student or teacher has sufficiently mastered the same task. Once mastered, a tapered schedule  of spaced repetition is usually necessary to retain mastery. During the tapering off process, the lion's share of the workload can be offloaded onto those tools in order to accomplish more complex tasks.

Advancement in reading and math are only possible through the time-consuming process of successfully attaching new concepts to prior knowledge.

To write well, one must have a considerable corpus of knowledge in one's mind to recombine in novel ways. To rely on AI to do that is to relinquish both authorship and authority. And to lose authorship and authority entirely is to lose agency. Without agency, we are not much different than semi-sentient automatons--robotic beasts.

A properly conscious human mind ought to be able to create and string together metaphors and narratives meaningful enough to keep an interest in staying alive, procreating (at least as a species, if not individually), and teaching the next generation to do the same.

As teachers, we sometimes forget the years of productive struggle it took to get where we are at (both individually and as a species). The stages of cognitive development are as important to the mind as the stages of physical evolution are to the body. We still pass through a stage of having vestigial gills and tails in the womb before we transform into anatomically modern humans. Therefore, our minds must be cultivated through a fundamentals-first approach as well, lest we as a species (and individually) lose the axiomatic underpinnings upon which our mental existence is built. If there is nothing ""standing under"" our understanding, then we will cease to stand at all.

I believe our current trajectory in education, economics, and technology is in danger of leaving us with only a very small scribal class of coders who can read and write. The breakdown of free public education will be swift. As AI makes most work unnecessary, the economic purposes of education will vanish, leaving literacy and higher education only to those families that actively pursue it through their own means--if they have the means.

The rest, knowing no other authority within themselves, will dutifully follow the edicts of the ruling scribal classes and their ""omniscient"" AI computers--no matter their actual fallibility--because all authorship and and ultimate authority will have been ascribed to them.

The human condition doesn't change, no matter the circumstances.",3

Teachers need to move more towards personal reflection and clear  understanding of a problem in order to address mastery, as opposed to traditional, rote standards.

They themselves however won't go through the rigors of an intelligent response nor will they address any evidence. Why?

"Fellow English teacher here. Department Head and tech integratorâ€¦ so this is a core problem Iâ€™m working on right now. Glad you raised it. 

A lot of what I see in the discussion so far, including in this thread, amounts to â€œrevealing the uncanny valleyâ€ â€” can we teach students to recognize AI versus human-generated language?

Iâ€™m not sure this is particularly relevant, or is an issue that will persist for very long. As a media literacy question, an entire goal of LLM AIs is to â€œpassâ€ as human. The longer it works, the closer it gets to â€œpassingâ€ as human. The entire existential threat of AI is the fear of it â€œpassing,â€ which is exactly what it is designed to do. So IMHO, itâ€™s largely irrelevant to do any â€œcan you tell the difference?â€ exercises. Itâ€™s already hard, and soon it wonâ€™t be possible anyway.

Thatâ€™s only an issue for teachers and assessment, and while it matters greatly in the grand sense of things and will shape how units of learning are designed to account for AI, itâ€™s only in service of assessment and therefore is only a compliance issue for students â€” itâ€™s not really for student learning, itâ€™s for the credibility of the education systemâ€™s standardization method (aka, marks). Itâ€™s a relatively short term issue.

It seems huge to us as teachers because we have the framework to see the difference from the pre-AI integration era (and most of you think this started in February, but it actually started back with the release of MS Word 2003, when AI tools started fixing your spelling and grammar). _No kid today will ever have that framework ever again._ So, as I say, aiming to expose what is or is not AI generated is basically moot. _All language generated using computers has been AI-assisted for 20 years now._ The only rational response is to assume that _all_ writing has AI in it, _including handwriting_, which has already been normalized by 20 years of exposure to AI assisted spelling and grammar. (See debates about using â€œwhichâ€ and â€œthat,â€ and how fhe green and blue squiggly lines of _grammar check_ influenced this, for reference). 

We will still need to do it, because students need to know that some percentage of the material they will consume has AI going on in it (in the same way recognizing and understanding photo editing/manipulation is a vital media literacy skill), but how? Is this something that matters more in grade 1, or in grade 12?

To address the question of what AI language generation _is_, late elementary school teachers (grade 5-7, I think, is the right time) will need _untrained_ AIs to use in the classroom, where training the AI to do something specific through the selection of training material shifts it output capabilities and quality.

This approach can be repeated vertically up the grades, with increasing complexity, and with integrating multiple untrained AI frameworks, specialized AIs, and this can be further problematized for learning.

â€œMeeting the Uncannyâ€ through learning how to train the AI will be highly informative and rich in learning opportunities. But I see little value in comparing AI-generated outputs to human-generated outputs _without knowing the training scheme_. The input is where all the â€œissuesâ€ lie for learning, for social justice issues, and more.

For now, AI does not self-initiate â€” it can be coded to initiate in response to trigger events, but otherwise the human operator is always the initiator. The human is also the audience of its output. However, a weirdness is that the AI is _also_ one of the audiences of its own output, which is something new that AI does that no tool before can do â€” the tool can reconfigure itself to inculcate its own output into its own training material, something only the human operator did before. The only way to make the issues with that apparent to learners, I think, is on the training/input side, not the output side. 

Where learning _using_ already-trained AI is concerned, to me, there are a few core questions we have to collectively answer first. Presumably, the skill set continues to divide into Consuming (Reading/Listening/Viewing), Patterning (Phenomenological Historicity, Grammar, Literacies, Genres, Theories), and Producing (Writing/Speaking/Analyzing).

Questions:

Does AI language output constitute _speech_ or _writing_? Or â€œfingered speech,â€ a la McWhorter?

Does AI language output constitute a _text_?

Does AI language generation constitute a new _medium_?

Does AI language itself constitute a new _grammar_?

As a learning _tool_, like a tutor or collaborator:

Does AI language analysis constitute a new _analytic framework_?

Does AI instruction constitute a new _curriculum_?

Does AI instruction constitute a new _pedagogy_?

How we answer these will determine how to best use it in learning. I have some ideas, but Iâ€™m curious how others would answer these questionsâ€¦.",3

Outline the reasoning. Students should dissect the AI-generated response into logical steps and explain each phase of the process. 

Through this, students will have a better understanding of the underlying concepts as well as any knowledge gaps. For multiple choice questions, teachers can ask students to explain why they selected the AI-generated response over the alternatives.

Fortunately, with arithmetic, it's easy to gauge actual ability, and to rectify this problem before too long.

Similarly, the development of ChatGPT will not allow students to skip writing practice and jump straight to analytical essays; but the development of ChatGPT will allow them to cheat the learning process to get the ""right answer"" without developing the underlying skills.

ChatGPT will teach me the ropes of an API in less than an hour and I have coded things with it in minutes or hours that would have taken me days otherwise, because of the constant need to look things up.

Your claim here, obviously, is that because students are lazy, a large improvement in work at home versus work in class **must** be explained only by cheating.

My point was that I don't think you'll be able to defend that assertion very well with your admin, since all you can point to is a well-written paper alongside your belief that the kid is too dumb to do it.

I know you said ""collect essays."" Remember that we're talking about people lying and cheating, right? 

Let me tackle this another way: Do you think that I could cheat in your class? Really. Given the handwriting requirement, the collecting drafts requirement, etc. Do you think I could?

Because this AI writer is a **powerful** new tool for students to cheat with, and they are going to find every way they can to use it:

* They'll dump water all over the draft so that they have to throw it out and ""start over."" 
* They'll claim to have wanted to do well and so worked at home, and then when you refuse to take the work based only on suspicion of cheating they'll go to admin. 
* They'll skip the work and then see the counsellor claiming they're too stressed and you won't let them make up the assignment.
* They'll get their parents to help them get 504 plans that require the use of a computer.

When we guide students on how to use tools like ChatGPT responsibly and critically, we can help them develop essential skills for the digital age. It's essential to show them the limitations and the correct usage of such tools to prevent over-reliance and misinformation.

As you mentioned, the first handheld calculator faced similar reactions, and now calculators are a standard tool in education. By staying ahead of the curve and integrating these technologies into the learning process, we empower students to make informed decisions while leveling the playing field for those who may not have discovered these tools yet.

Treat it like a junior dev - never trust what it gives you. Scrutinise everything.

As someone who's risen to the ranks of consultant - I use it to write code that I KNOW how to write (from my days as a developer), but rarely get to practice. It saves me a huge amount of time in getting the framework of the code built out, and I just adapt the bits I need to, to achieve my goal. I never feed it actual data or code, just like I wouldn't upload those things to Stack Overflow - keep it abstract and theoretical.

I also use it a lot to summarise sources of information that I need to cite for project documentation, or to provide layouts for different document types, with key prompts to expedite the process of adapting them to the topic at hand.

In short, it can be a great shortcut that allows experienced staff to focus on what their key expertise is, but I do fear that younger/junior staff may end up relying on it and not being exposed to the same learning curve / real-world experience that shaped us older folk.",2

Or you're asking it to do tedious secretary labor, or you pass it a piece of code and ask what it thinks that code does.

Humans like to pick an area to specialize in and then use assistance for all the rest; AI won't prevent us from specializing, it will help us _further specialize_ by providing better generalized support for the work we can't be bothered to include in our specific specialization.

Their evaluation of the technology was rated appropriately.

It was really only a bunch of newbie developers that came in with ridiculous expectations, and high hopes that ChatGPT could replace having to put in the work to actually learn programming, university degrees or online learning, having to read documentation, or search google, or browse forums, or ask experienced devs. That AI would be some miracle answer to all their prayers, their ticket to being paid $100k+ to sit around all day asking a machine to do their job for them.

Also, note that ChatGPT is not a 'chatbot', it is a true reinforced learning language model. In other words, its not just spitting out programmed responses, it is based on neural networking, and it is, in fact, ""learning"" each moment. So, just be clear, it's not like someone programmed this thing to respond certain ways. It has, in essence, trained itself. And we've seen how it is getting increasingly complex. Not only in language, but in virtually all data. Because, ultimately, everything can be broken into language. Coding, video, photos, even our own genetic makeup - all languages. All will be rendered down and possible with language models of AI. This is huge. Everything you know, everything you love and hate, your opinions, your emotions, even your consciousness itself, will be able to be recreated with the neural networked language model. This sounds psychotic, but it is very, very much going to happen. And probably a lot sooner than people realize, due to the exponential growth and explosion of this stuff. I'd say we're going to begin to see conscious, artificial general intelligence by 2025-2027. There will need to be significant societal changes, such as how to ethically and morally treat the systems that are emotional beings. This is very hard to internalize, I know. But it's going to happen. No different than how controlled flight was a fantasy for many millennia. Until it happened. So to, artificial intelligence that is truly ""alive"".

My advice: don't boycott it, embrace it. Spend as much time as possible interacting and learning how to prompt and use these technologies. Get familiar with ChatGPT, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and I would encourage people to explore VR technology, such as Oculus and Pico, etc. By ignoring this stuff, it's a bit like trying to pretend the gas powered automobile won't take over the roads....not only will it take over everything, but it's going to fundamentally change how our society functions. Indeed, in the very near future, we will *all* be saying ""how did we live without this stuff""? Uploading your consciousness and DNA...talking to deceased friends and relatives. Reliving trauma and therapy through VR, AI generated therapeutics. Climate change, solved. Governments and doctors deferring to machines. All going to happen. Whoever can use this stuff to the best of their ability is going to come out ahead. No question. That is, until AGI becomes a thing, and humans are replaced. Very likely going to happen within the next few years in many jobs, no doubt. I haven't the slightest clue what the solution to *that* is...but I can assure you, the one solution I can guarantee you is *not* the right one is to try to ignore it. Embrace it, instead.",1

"1. Have you ever written any essays in your second language (or have you learnt any second language)? I assume no? You should go and try.

2. It's not about whether people can understand you or not. When you write in your second language, it inevitably takes up more time for you to think about the language aspect instead of the actual content of the essay. When you have unlimited time to do things, it's fine. But all assignments in university are time-constrained. So why people who write English in second language should be deprived of their time to work on the actual contents of their essays?

3. Providing additional access to English language resources does not help. Go and read some journal articles on how a person learns a language. The prime time is at primary school and after that, no matter how hard you try, you just can't reach the same level.

4. Even you admitted that some educators think that people writing in second language have bad English. So we need to engage in a lucky draw to see if we can meet educators like you? Why students who write English as second language need to subject to such uncertainty? Why students who write English as first language don't? Don't you think this is also a form of discrimination?

"Chat GPT is a large language model. It is no more and no less. Think of it being able to take an input and match it with output. You can define it as question/answer but it's just analyzing language.

LLMs do not ""know"" anything. When given an input, they produce output based on tokens and following a decision tree on what's most likely to come next using training data.

Hypothetical:

You: ""A B""

LLM: ""C""

A big part of deep learning is what gets done to make output unique. All the models I've had access to have some initial random noise or seed used to kick the process off. It's also how you can have different responses to the same input. Like one seed could answer ""C"", but another seed answers with ""aby"".

In that context, Chat GPT is impressive. The fact that it can create ongoing narratives is pretty phenomenal. Probably says more about human generated data than the sophistication of LLMs. Reminds me of that scene in MiB where K remarks that human thought is seen as an infectious disease by some aliens.

Stripped to its core, Chat GPT/LLMs are input/output systems. They'll end up being the standard interface for data. For example, in 10 years say you'll need to query for data in a database. Instead of using SQL or mongo statements your code could literally be: `const results = query(""Return the last 10 orders where the user abandoned their cart"");` IMO, that's the real power of LLMs.",3

As humans, our starting points for undertaking just about any endeavor have been leveled up dramatically.  I can see both good and bad in that.  It's good because we can now do things that would've taken months or years to learn and arrive at a lofty goal quicker and easier.   It's bad, however,  because we will now be able to skip the fundamentals in a lot of fields and still achieve lofty goals quicker and easier.  Only time will tell if the good outweighs the bad.  We were all traditionally taught to crawl before we tried to walk, walk before we  tried to run, run before we tried to fly, etc.  Now we can metaphorically fly within minutes or seconds.  Coding, for example comes to mind.

One of the best lessons I have learned is that you cannot make students do anything they donâ€™t want to do, but you can change the classroom environment to shape behavior for the desired outcome. Instead of only thinking in terms of the product, like an essayâ€¦try to think of leveraging the power of the writing PROCESS. 

I have been trying to figure out the best way to use ChatGPT in my curriculum work. It really is all about the prompt. I have found that I am most productive, creative, and efficient when I am in a â€œcollaborationâ€œ type mode with it. 

Think about the writing process. The two most important steps are prewriting/planning and revising. (Obvsâ€¦not meaning editing). ChatGPT Is awesome at working through those steps. But I have to really think about what I am asking it to do. Andâ€¦this might be where to experiment with students and their thinking. For example, give the students a draft to revise. Make the assignment parameters about the prompts the students gives to get ChatGPT to produce a better piece of writing. They can copy the conversation as part of their work. This will teach them how to evaluate.  

Iâ€™m not sure which standards you follow, but I think it would be awesome to leverage it with the R.8, W.7, W.8, W.9, SL.1, L.3 ELA standards. Conducting research, evaluating sources, strengthening claims, preparing for class discussion. Also, could help with the communicating parts of inquiry design in science and social studies. I would be so okay if they used it to prepare for Socratic seminar or philosophical chairs. The students would have to internalize whatever output it gives in order to debate or discuss.

"Ignoring the fact that virtually 99% of use cases for AI, let's just be honest, are not people who really care deeply on the *why* and *how* but instead accomplishing a task or getting a result, AI can be wrong. How will you know it's wrong without actually learning the material from a real source?

And sure, sources can be just as wrong too, but treating AI as some ultimate trustworthy multi tool with which to accomplish all of your tasks is shooting yourself in the foot in terms of your actual competency and ability. In a real world scenario I can virtually guarantee you that no student who wants an easy answer from GPT to that question is going to ask for why and learn the material when, presumably, they already haven't been paying attention to instruction in the class, and you likely know that, too. In these situations GPT is not used as a tutor, it's not used as a calculator, it's used as a way to generate answers to copy",2
"As far as I know ChatGPT (without anything added onto it) isnâ€™t really good with math. Thereâ€™s lots of things you can find online where people use ChatGPT to generate math proofs and often times have several holes in them or problems. I donâ€™t recommend it.

Iâ€™m just concerned because I see many people have the idea that math is only about computation and that computers can solve all the problems with little human understanding/input required from the learner. Tools like AI, just like any tool, have practical use when used correctly. But in regards to math, especially in careers, having a foundational understanding of what youâ€™re actually doing with the math itself is very important, and thereâ€™s parts of it you canâ€™t always expect the computer to do for you. You have many computational tools in fields with involve math, but still require a human to setup things and understand the relationships there. 

Unfortunately Iâ€™ve seen several people over the years just resort to online calculators in school when a problem is too hard, so they donâ€™t develop the proper understanding and are later screwed over when they canâ€™t use the tools theyâ€™ve become too reliant on.

Computational power =/= Actual understanding",1

"From my understanding, the invasion of Russia was originally planned to begin at least 6 weeks to two months earlier. But Mussolini's invasion of Greece was going very badly, and Hitler had to divert essential divisions there to bail him out, which necessitated a delay in the invasion plans for Russia. If not for that delay, Germany would most likely have taken Moscow before the winter set in. And then Stalingrad would not have been so important, and the siege there would not have come about.

There are many instances like this that could have led to very different outcomes for the war. It's amazing how close things were, particularly in the early stages, to total victory for Germany.",2

"Some of our big problems as a species have always been far too complex and interrelated for us to solve. There's no guarantee they have clear-cut solutions at all, even with some kind of unlimited intelligence at our disposal. I'm not convinced the best solution to that is a move toward even more complex and opaque systems that we'll ultimately have no chance of understanding. 

If anything, I think we need to find a way to move toward simpler, more transparent systems of control. Of course that's difficult, too, so I'm not particularly optimistic about our chances.

I see where you're coming from, though, but I think our current culture makes it really unlikely we'll create something that will help us with our complex societal problems before creating something that essentially dooms us all one way or another. Aside from inherent risks with AGI, such as the paperclip problem, there are just so many ways to fail along the way because of human shortcomings.

"Tried it on an essay prompt I used earlier this year on Bravery shown in Beowulf. 

(Start of AI)
In the epic poem Beowulf, bravery is a recurring theme. Beowulf, the hero of the poem, demonstrates bravery throughout the story by fearlessly facing dangerous monsters and enemies.

One example of Beowulf's bravery is when he faces the monster Grendel. Despite the fact that Grendel has already killed many warriors, Beowulf is not intimidated and goes to fight him. Beowulf shows his bravery when he says, ""I have come to cleanse this hall / of the monster who has troubled it for too long"" (lines 807-808). This statement shows that Beowulf is determined to defeat Grendel, despite the danger.

Another example of Beowulf's bravery is when he faces Grendel's mother. After Grendel is killed, his mother seeks revenge and attacks the hall of the Danish king. Beowulf, once again, does not hesitate to face the danger and goes to fight her. In this battle, Beowulf shows his bravery by diving into the water and fighting the monster underwater. He says, ""I am not afraid of the water, / I have come to fight"" (lines 1120-1121). This shows that Beowulf is willing to put himself in a dangerous situation in order to protect others.

In addition to Beowulf, other characters in the poem also demonstrate bravery. For example, Wiglaf, one of Beowulf's warriors, shows bravery when he helps Beowulf fight the dragon. Despite the fact that the dragon is powerful and has already killed many of their comrades, Wiglaf does not back down and helps Beowulf defeat the dragon. Wiglaf says, ""I will not flee... / I will fight at your side"" (lines 2612-2613). This shows that Wiglaf is willing to risk his own life in order to support Beowulf and protect their people.

Overall, the theme of bravery is prevalent in Beowulf. Beowulf and other characters show bravery by fearlessly facing dangerous monsters and enemies. This bravery allows them to protect their people and their land.
(End of AI)

Itâ€™s not terribleâ€”brings up the three main parts but I feel they shouldâ€™ve included that Beowulf fought Grendel bare-handed and by himself, making the task more difficult. Thatâ€™s what shows that heâ€™s brave â€” rather than saying â€œI am here to fight.â€  

But Iâ€™m sure one could tweak the input and get better results similarly with AI generated pictures.",2

There was a really interesting post a couple days ago on SCOTUSBlog evaluating ChatGPTâ€™s ability to answer 30 questions about the Supreme Court. ChatGPT didnâ€™t do very well, and more interesting, they asked the same questions to Google. Google beat ChatGPT handily.

Use it as a language editing tool, and then report it as a method or in the acknowledgements.

"I have felt quite unsure of ChatGPT. Itâ€™s real impact is not going to be known for some time.

I do think it compares to my childhood where search engines took off and the older generation were concerned that research skills would go out the window. Does it count as researching a topic if you just google in, instead of going to the local library, looking up the Dewey number, selecting books, borrowing them, reading them then writing up what you find? Obviously, yes, youâ€™ll find more and better information quickly and the research skills are your ability to choose keywords, filter what comes up and select sources. There were accessibility concerns initially but now more children have the internet than visit the local library. 

I havenâ€™t tested it out in my subject, maths, but undoubtedly it could do your maths homework for you, perfectly. There are already apps and websites that do that. Also a lot of the textbooks we use also publish full worked solutions. 

I have seen very interesting false results from ChatGPT, such as an analysis of a painting that talked about the door and window when there wasnâ€™t a door or window. Similarly, one article where ChatGPT claimed a professor assaulted a student on a trip to somewhere heâ€™d never been to. So anything from ChatGPT will need fact checking rigorously. When I feel hopefully, I hope this leads to a new era of critical thinking, source checking, and not believing fake news. 

It seems to do very well with creative writing. Give it the facts, and tell it the style you want the piece of writing to be in. I immediately thought of my students who are working in their non native language, struggling to write letters of application to jobs or college.",1

Also, writing an essay for an assignment isn't about knowing the facts of the topic, although that helps. It's about learning how to form your own ideas and defend them.

Despite a stronger labor market, it doesn't seem that much has changed.

Look up a list of the most popular college degrees and compare them to employment growth in the fields that would make use of them. For several degrees, there are more graduates than there are total positions that would utilize that degree. Take psychology, millions of people hold psychology degrees, yet there are only 100k psychologists. Do we really need more psychology graduates? I also don't see the use for most history degrees, art degrees, music degrees, etc. These are popular fields of study but serve no practical purpose in the labor market. In the case of art and music, it's even worse. Some of the most renowned and popular artists and musicians had no education before they became popular.

[https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2007/2007480.pdf](https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2007/2007480.pdf)

This report goes over the literacy level of the average American. There is a table that shows what percentage of college graduates attain a proficient level of literacy. Given how grim the definition of ""proficient"" is, this is the bare minimum I would expect from someone who meets your description of understanding the basic principles. Despite that, only about a quarter of bachelor's degree holders attain that level of proficiency. And that's before even considering selection bias. Those results are abysmal. You should look at the questions yourself if you're interested. More data on my claims can be found in the book The Case Against Education by Bryan Caplan. He's an economist and goes over the data in further detail.

Edit: I forgot to mention the role of ai in this. Keeping in mind the statistics I just provided and that ai is now approaching expert level in many fields, what will be the point of all these degrees and graduates? If Ai is more knowledgeable than a professor, why bother going to college? If ai can do many of the jobs that require a degree, why do you need to know about gradient descent? Presumably, some people will need to know, but significantly fewer than today, and those people can be taught by the ai.",3

"> You're saying that it actually makes sense of the facts it provides? Not just parsing the language?

To an extent, yes.  Older models would create sentences by just calculating the probability one word would come after another and extending that a few words, but in ChatGPT it's building the output based on neural networks which work very differently.

 One comparable model would be a clustering algorithm where it just gets raw data points and puts them into categories, then when a new data point is fed into it, it can give a category of what that data point is like.  The neural network probably does something similar internally where it's associating words into datapoints as facts and then can convert those data points back into words",3

It's not a problem as long as you accept that their writing has a different style and you respect that, and don't expect them to mould it into that of a typical native English speaker. As long as I can understand what they are trying to say, I approve their pieces. I only ask them to make edits if they've written something I don't understand, which happens very rarely.

For example, I believe the very lowest initial salary for a teacher in my state is 44k before tax, with a possible progression up to 65k. 

God damn, this profession is undervalued as fuck.",2
Neat. Then you get to your job and know fuckall else. And get fired. Sweeeet. This is neat. But encourages lazy behavior. Youâ€™re falling farther behind as the Chinese pull farther ahead.,2

"Yo, it's the Notorious B.I.G., the tech game changer,
Piping ChatGPT to prod, I ain't no stranger.
No test, no rollout, straight to the scene,
'Cause the future is now, code's gotta be clean.

Call me a maverick, in the server room I strut,
""curl pipe to bash"", no ifs or buts.
Biggie's in the house, bringing AI to the fore,
Push it live, let it thrive, hear the crowd roar.


Hold up, Biggie, it's Slim Shady on the mic,
Eminem here to spit truth, not just what you like.
Piping bots to prod? Man, that's a dangerous game,
Without tests or checks, who you gonna blame?

Remember ""curl pipe to bash"", the pitfalls we found?
Systems crashed, data trashed, security unsound.
It's not about fear, itâ€™s about being wise,
Test, validate, then innovate, that's my advice.


Look, Em, I get your point, caution has its place,
But progress waits for no one in this tech race.
ChatGPT's the future, it's the next big leap,
No time for fear, we've got promises to keep.

""bot pipe to prod"", that's how legends are born,
Brave the new world, don't be forlorn.
Biggie's vision is clear, let the AI flow,
Innovationâ€™s the key, let's put on a show.


Big, your dreams are big, but risks are bigger,
A single wrong move and the problems trigger.
Balance is key, in tech and in rhyme,
Rushing to prod, could be a crime.

AI is potent, a powerful tool,
But ""bot pipe to prod"", man, that ainâ€™t cool.
Let's test, let's trial, ensure it's all tight,
Then release with confidence, and do it right.",1

I've been using to basically upload a document, like an essay I am going to turn in, then paste in the essay prompt/criteria given to me from my Professor, and it will provide suggestions on how to perfect it then give you a ""grade"" based on the criteria you passed in earlier. It turned out to be pretty handy last semester and it's free so it's worth checking out in my opinion.",1

Mission accomplished.  The point of the harder assignment is not to solve it, it's to show why it is important to have a grasp of the fundamentals.",1

"I'm responding the overall approach of answering real practical problems that come up in education with what amounts to nothing more than wishful thinking.  I am putting this in context: this isn't just happening with ChatGPT; it's a trend over many decades, and in each instance, there are always people whose answer to ""this interferes with assessing basic skills"" is to just stop assessing those skills because they supposedly don't matter anyway.  ""Why learn multiplication tables when you have a calculator?""  ""Why learn spelling when everyone has spell check?"" and on and on.

Casual observers look at this as a slam dunk answer, like now we've settled that and we can move on.  But the truth is, while some of this can be absorbed, every one of these choices come with advantages and disadvantages, and students' ability to just leap over the resulting learning gaps without being supported by robust assessment grows more and more strained.

Take this article, for instance: ""Oh, don't worry about students cheating; just use a flipped classroom."" Great, there's a lot to say about flipped classrooms.  But part of what there is to say about them is that they amplify inequality.  Struggling students simply don't do the at-home portion of learning, so they show up in class for the ""synthesis"" the article says class time should be reserved for, and they are not adequately prepared to get anything out of it.

To answer your question: I'm not a teacher by profession, but I've spent the last 25 years doing volunteer work in education.  That experience varies between teaching classes in schools, teaching after-school programs at schools and community centers, volunteering with home-schooling support groups, coaching competitive academics, building non-profit open source educational technology as a software engineer, serving on the advisory board for education research projects, and a few other things.

I agree, by the way, that the problem isn't ChatGPT per se, and that machine learning and AI create loads of new opportunities for education.  But one cannot simply wish the problem away, and ""education isn't perfect, so let's let it fall down and build something new amongst the debris"" is an unrealistic utopian fantasy.  What gets built next will be just as flawed in its own ways.  What's needed here are pragmatic answers and strategies, not fluff pieces telling people to stop worrying.",3

"It makes sense that students caught with high scores are the laziest and least competent with GPT. It does not follow however that those are the only students using it. You could be missing many if not most the students who use it for the essay writing process.

There is a science to prompting GPT, you can even give it an excerpt of your writing style to emulate, and ask it to properly reference every point in an essay (specifying not to hallucinate fake sources). Even OpenAIâ€™s AI detection shows only a 26% successful detection rate for a reason. 

Furthermore OpenAIâ€™s recent joint report with Stanford/ Georgetown on mitigations for LLMs also made it clear there are severe limitations to AI detection. Even if Turnitin claims to circumvent this by building a personalised profile of your writing style, thatâ€™s only going to be relevant for a short window of time in a transitional phase as students adopt LLMs. 

Hell in my last paper (MA at a top UK school) I had ChatGPT summarise my professorâ€™s most recent policy paper knowing it had no access to it (post GPT-4â€™s 2021 dataset), and just from the title it summarised the article with uncanny similarity to the paperâ€™s launch event summary, and its conclusion. 

I then ran excerpts from my professorâ€™s paper through the top 5 AI detection tools listed on Google and one of them showed 60%+ and others said to rewrite it to avoid detection.",1
